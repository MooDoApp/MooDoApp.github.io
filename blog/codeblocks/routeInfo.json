The incidents of these errors happening increased over time until it affected almost everybody, for some reason. So we’ve switched to a more reliable authentication method.</p>\n<p>We’re now doing server-side Google plugin authentication, saving refresh tokens in the database so Moo.do’s backend can authenticate you, instead of depending on Google’s client-side authentication. This should now stop asking for reauthentication and also not require authenticating again on every device.</p>\n<p>Moo.do will continue to use the old method as long as it works for you, but if you reauthenticate it will use the new method and should fix this for good. If you prefer to use the old method for some reason, you can disable “Use new authentication” in the General settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical details:</strong> We had liked the security benefit of client-side authentication because then our server could not access your accounts, so we’ve come up with a new secure method for server-side authentication. Part of the refresh token is encrypted on the user account and inaccessible to the server, while the other part is in an area that only the server can access. This way the server cannot access your accounts by itself - it needs the client app to send the other part of the refresh token in order to create a new authentication token.</p>\n<h1 id=\"code-blocks\">Code Blocks</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"/blog/inboxpane\">previous update</a> opened up a lot more flexibility in how we display items, so we’re now able to add this highly requested feature of code blocks.</p>\n<p>Code Blocks can be created by starting an item with <span class=\"hotkey\">``` + Space</span> or select it from the / help menu. It will try to automatically detect the language as you type, or you can select the language from the menu. Editing works differently inside a code block: Enter creates a new line in the code block, and <span class=\"hotkey\"><span class=\"hotkeyPri\"></span> + A</span> selects the whole code block (the first time).</p>\n<p><img class=\"postImg\" src=\"/blog/img/update-code-blocks.png\"></img></p>\n<p>If you have any requests for improving the code blocks (or anything else) please let us know <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/beta/\">in our beta group</a> or at <a href=\"mailto:contact@moo.do\">contact@moo.do</a>.</p>\n"}],"isSinglePost":true}}
