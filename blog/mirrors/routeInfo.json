Whereas Item Links insert a link to an item which can be clicked to zoom in, Item Mirrors directly embed the full item and its children. This lets you effectively put one item in multiple places. Since it is another instance of the same item, edits instantly appear in both places.</p>\n<p>This has transformed the way our beta testers use Moo.do as they can now create dashboards which show all their active projects, better manage dependencies, or group items together in different ways.</p>\n<p>To insert an item link, type <span class=\"hotkey\">((</span> to open an autocomplete to select the item to mirror. Or you can use drag/drop or the Move menu.</p>\n<h1 id=\"drag-drop-and-move\">Drag Drop and Move</h1>\n<p>Drag Drop and the Move menu have been significantly upgraded with new options. You can now press modifier keys (described in the bottom status bar) to copy, link, or mirror the items in addition to the normal move.</p>\n<h1 id=\"bug-fixes\">Bug fixes</h1>\n<p>We also have a lot of important bug fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Items with Google Calendar events now sync with their calendar representations immediately</li>\n<li>Agenda views were hiding overdue google calendar items even if created in the current document</li>\n<li>Enter was not working while search was open</li>\n<li>Indenting in grouped views was losing selection</li>\n<li>Better handling of plugin sync errors</li>\n<li>Boards’ conflict resolution while syncing offline changes works better</li>\n<li>When calendar pane is small, view mode buttons now change to a single button with a menu instead of just disappearing</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"isSinglePost":true}}
