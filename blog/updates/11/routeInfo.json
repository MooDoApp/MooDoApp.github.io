This update improves Moo.do everywhere: on the web, Chrome, iOS, and Android.</p>\n<p>We’re serious when we say this is a <strong>huge</strong> upgrade. Check it out:</p>\n<p>\n    <img class=\"postImg postImgPerf\" src=\"/blog/img/update-performance1.png\" />\n    <img class=\"postImg postImgPerf\" src=\"/blog/img/update-performance2.png\" />\n    <img class=\"postImg postImgPerf\" src=\"/blog/img/update-performance3.png\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>This update was an unexpected delay in our roadmap. As we got into the development of the Gmail plugin and began loading our inboxes into Moo.do, we realized we could not provide a good email experience until we fixed the performance problems. Moo.do was fast with a few hundred items, but as documents grew over time, Moo.do was unable to keep up. It was especially noticeable with the mobile apps, which were basically unusable with large documents. Adding large email inboxes into the mix made it clear that we had to focus on performance before we could continue.</p>\n<p>Now, Moo.do is snappy even with tens of thousands of items. And now that this big change is done, we’re back to building the features you’ve been waiting for. We have a new and much stronger foundation which is better designed for our future plans, so development will move much faster now.</p>\n<p>We did some cool things technically to make Moo.do this fast, which we will detail in a future post. So we’ll end this one with the usual list of things we’re working on next.</p>\n<h1 id=\"in-development\">In Development</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Calendar sync</li>\n<li>Gmail integration</li>\n</ul>\n<style>\n.postImgPerf {\n    width: 682px;\n    margin: 40px auto;\n}\n</style>\n"},{"title":"Recent Roadmap Changes","slug":"updated-roadmap","category":"updates","date":"Sat Jun 27 2015 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","contents":"<p>We’ve spent the past month working on improving Moo.do’s performance, based on your feedback and to get ready for the Gmail and Google Calendar integrations. We found a way to dramatically improve Moo.do’s speed and load time, but the changes required ended up being larger than expected. The delay is totally worth it though, as Moo.do will soon be able to handle tens of thousands of items with ease and feel much snappier overall. This update will improve our apps on all platforms: web, Chrome, iOS, and Android.</p>\n<p>After this performance upgrade, we plan to spend some time working on some of the most requested features before starting the next big project that is the Gmail plugin.</p>\n<p>We want to be totally transparent about what we’re working on, and we know we haven’t been as good about that as we should be. So we’re going to post updates on our blog more often about what we’re doing and what is coming. To get that started, this is an overview of how we expect to spend the next few months:</p>\n<h2 id=\"upcoming-roadmap\">Upcoming roadmap</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Finish the performance upgrade</li>\n<li>Important and highly requested features:<ul>\n<li>Google Calendar sync</li>\n<li>Improved search UI</li>\n<li>Improved Agenda: Making it directly editable, showing context of what list an item is in, showing the children of an item</li>\n<li>Notes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Start on Gmail plugin</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"title":"Google Drive and Premium","slug":"premium","category":"updates","date":"Wed May 06 2015 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","uid":"launchPremium","contents":"<p>For the past six months since our public launch, we’ve focused on improving the free version of Moo.do, including what we believe are basic features that every productivity app needs to have for free: real-time collaboration, offline support, availability on every device, and no limits on usage. We really appreciate your feedback and support that has helped us shape Moo.do into a great tool for managing projects, tasks, and to-do lists. Now it’s time to make Moo.do into much more than just a to-do list app.</p>\n<p>Moo.do was started with the goal of organizing everything in one place. The first step of that was to be great at organizing one thing, so Moo.do has thus far been an app for organizing lists of text. We’ve spent the past few months building a plugin system that enables integration of all of the services you depend on into one organization system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"google-drive-integration\">Google Drive Integration</h2>\n<p>Today we’re launching Moo.do’s first plugin: Google Drive. You can view the entire contents of your Drive within Moo.do in the new Drive Pane, drag files or folders onto your lists, search and focus the Drive Panes on individual folders, and drag files from your computer right into your Moo.do lists. Drive files work just like any other text in Moo.do: you can prioritize, schedule, tag, complete, and star them.</p>\n<p>Try this live demo to see how the new Drive Pane works:</p>\n<div class=\"twoPane demobg\">\n    <div id=\"demoPremium\"></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"premium\">Premium</h2>\n<p>Together with the Drive plugin, we’re launching our Premium plan. All of the features currently available in Moo.do will remain free, but premium users will have access to the new Drive plugin as well as <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/premium/\">many more Premium features</a> in the future. To celebrate the Premium launch, we have special Early Adopter pricing of $4.95 / month, a 30% discount from the regular price. If you sign up now, you get Early Adopter pricing for life! You can sign up for Premium and get discounts for inviting your friends from the settings menu in the desktop version of Moo.do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"discounts-for-inviting-friends\">Discounts for inviting friends</h2>\n<p>You get 20% off of your Premium plan for every friend you invite that signs up. You can stack that discount as many times as you want, so if 20 of your friends sign up for Moo.do, you’ll get 4 months for free! The friends you invite also get their first month of Moo.do Premium for free, so everyone wins :).</p>\n<h2 id=\"help-us-grow\">Help us grow</h2>\n<p>We really appreciate your support in becoming a Premium user and inviting your friends, which helps us get our new features and integrations into your hands as quickly as possible. Thank you!</p>\n\n\n<style>\n#post_launchPremium .demo {\n    display: block;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n}\n#post_launchPremium .demobg {\n    position: relative;\n    margin: 30px auto;\n    max-width: 100%;\n}\nhtml:not(.mobile) #post_launchPremium .demobg {\n    height: 440px;\n}\n#post_launchPremium .demobg:not(.demoimg) {\n    width: 100%;\n}\n#post_launchPremium .demoimg {\n    width: 100%;\n    display: block;\n}\n</style>","script":"window.__addDemo(\n{\n    id: 'demoPremium',\n    src: '/web/#demo=true&touch=false&data=blog-drive.0&panes=1:PaneDrive&dmode=0xB1',\n    img: '/img/ss/blog/premium/demoPremium.png'\n}\n);"},{"title":"Development Update 4/16","slug":"update-04-16","category":"updates","date":"Thu Apr 16 2015 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","contents":"<p>We’ve been quiet recently while working on big new features for Moo.do, so we just wanted to update everyone on some recent changes and the roadmap for the next few months.</p>\n<h2 id=\"collapsing\">Collapsing</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Collapsing is now per pane so that panes can be better used to focus on different areas of your lists.</li>\n<li>Collapsed state will now be saved when you switch documents.</li>\n<li>Search automatically expands collapsed items.

With Mailbird and Moo.do, email becomes a real to-do list that you can organize, prioritize, and schedule right alongside all your other projects and tasks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.getmailbird.com\"><img src=\"/img/mailbird.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>Moo.do is built into <a href=\"http://www.getmailbird.com\">Mailbird 2.0</a> as a dedicated sidebar, so you can drag your emails from Mailbird right into your Moo.do lists. It’s also an app inside Mailbird for a full-screen view of your Moo.do workflow. You can easily open emails from your task list: click an email in Moo.do and Mailbird opens it for you.</p>\n<p>Organizing email and tasks together has completely transformed the way we use email. We don’t have to manually write down emails that need follow up. We don’t miss important emails because we can prioritize and schedule them alongside our other tasks and appointments.</p>\n<p>We’re super excited about this integration with Mailbird and we hope it makes you less frustrated and more productive!</p>\n<p>Get Mailbird 2.0 at <a href=\"http://www.getmailbird.com\">http://www.getmailbird.com</a>.</p>\n<style>\n#post_mailbird img {\n    position: relative;\n    margin: 30px auto;\n    max-width: 100%;\n}\n</style>"}],"numPages":13,"path":"/blog/updates"}}
