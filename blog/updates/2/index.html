Moo.do is now going to integrate into Gmail, instead of integrating Gmail into Moo.do.</p>\n<h1 id=\"chrome-extension\">Chrome Extension</h1>\n<p>Our new Chrome extension adds a button to the top of Gmail to select a Moo.do document, which will add the selected email to the top of that document.

But in February they said it was all for nothing, the security assessment would in fact be required, and immediately unverified Moo.do. So we have been scrambling to get verified again and find a new solution for integrating with Gmail. This extension and Add-On are still very basic just to get something out as quickly as possible, and we will continue to improve them and add more features.
