As you scroll your list it highlights and tracks your position in the document. Clicking any item in the Overview will scroll to it and dragging items onto the Overview moves them to the list they are dropped on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/img/update-overview1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"postImg postImgOutline\" src=\"/blog/img/update-overview1.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is an important change for the Gmail plugin.
