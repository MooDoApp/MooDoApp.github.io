<p>With the new search you can easily set a minimum priority and show or hide completed and starred items. You can toggle these filters with the same hotkeys that you use on your lists.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgSearch" src="/blog/img/update-search1.gif" /></p>
<p>Searching for dates is more powerful and easier to use. Searching for a <span class="date">@date</span> will match all items that fall on that date rather than just matching the text. For example, a search for <span class="date">@tomorrow</span> will show items on <span class="date">@10/27</span> or <span class="date">@tuesday</span>.</p>

With that done, we are happy to announce that items in the Agenda pane are now editable!</p>
<p>To make editing in the Agenda pane feel good, items need to move gracefully as their dates and priorities change instead of jumping around or disappearing completely if a date is invalid. We achieve this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delaying moving an Agenda item until a different item is selected</li>
<li>Animating the item into its new position to make it clear what is changing.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="postImg postImgAgenda" src="/blog/img/update-editable-agenda1.gif" /></p>
<p>Another benefit of being able to animate items as their positions change is that it makes it clearer what is happening during search. Also it looks really cool :).</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgAgenda" src="/blog/img/update-editable-agenda2.gif" /></p>
<p>This is important for the Google Calendar plugin to work well because it will allow you to change your Google Calendar event names or dates/times right in the Agenda. We’re doing final testing of the Google Calendar plugin now, so you’ll see it soon!</p>

<p>This update was an unexpected delay in our roadmap. As we got into the development of the Gmail plugin and began loading our inboxes into Moo.do, we realized we could not provide a good email experience until we fixed the performance problems. Moo.do was fast with a few hundred items, but as documents grew over time, Moo.do was unable to keep up. It was especially noticeable with the mobile apps, which were basically unusable with large documents. Adding large email inboxes into the mix made it clear that we had to focus on performance before we could continue.</p>
<p>Now, Moo.do is snappy even with tens of thousands of items. And now that this big change is done, we’re back to building the features you’ve been waiting for. We have a new and much stronger foundation which is better designed for our future plans, so development will move much faster now.</p>
<p>We did some cool things technically to make Moo.do this fast, which we will detail in a future post. So we’ll end this one with the usual list of things we’re working on next.</p>
