Large lists update much faster when typing and adding items, or when searching or filtering. There’s still more optimizations we can do, but this should be a big improvement for those of you with a lot of items. And we also fixed a good number of mobile bugs in general. If you’re still seeing any issues on mobile please let us know in our <a href=\"/beta\">beta community</a> or just <a href=\"mailto:support@moo.do\">email us</a>. We will continue to focus on the mobile app for a while, so it will keep getting better.</p>\n<h1 id=\"bug-fixes\">Bug fixes</h1>\n<p>We’ve fixed a ton of small bugs over the past month with a focus on plugin sync, so sync with Google services is much more stable now.

We’ve been hard at work on building a brand new mobile app from scratch. After 6 months, 51 beta updates, and with the help of 72 patient beta testers, it’s finally ready for full release!</p>\n<p>For this first version of the new mobile app we focused on reimplementing the existing features and design, but in a much higher quality package. So it looks and works mostly the same as the old version but is faster, smoother, and less buggy. From here we can make it even faster, rethink the design, and quickly add lots of new features.\n<br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moo.do-organize-your-way/id889830074?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">Download iOS App</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moo.do\">Download Android</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"what-s-new\">What’s New</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Faster load time</li>\n<li>Smoother interaction</li>\n<li>Better and less buggy typing experience</li>\n<li>Supports editing of text in items with dates, emails, or files</li>\n<li>Swipe menus are more intuitive</li>\n<li>Emails are sized to fit the screen and support zooming</li>\n<li>Overall less buggy</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"web-desktop-changes\">Web / Desktop Changes</h1>\n<p>We’ve been pretty quiet on the blog here because we’ve been working on this huge project for so long. But we have released some important features and fixes along the way. You can see the <a href=\"/changelog/\">changelog</a> for the full details of all the updates, but here are the major changes from the past few months:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of improvements to sync stability, calendar views, and copy/paste</li>\n<li>The add item popup now has document and calendar selectors</li>\n<li>Sharing a document with a non-Moo.do user will send an email inviting them to collaborate on the document</li>\n<li>A new view for Deleted Items to browse and undelete them</li>\n<li>A maximize button on the email compose window</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"technical-details\">Technical Details</h1>\n<p>The previous app was a mobile web app in a native wrapper. It was generally fine, but there were some editing bugs that were impossible to solve within the constraints of a mobile web app. So we built the new app in React Native, which allowed us to reuse much of the same code, although we had to rebuild the user interface and a lot of the app’s core from scratch. And along the way we also converted the whole codebase to TypeScript and ES2018, so it is much cleaner and easier to extend.</p>\n<h1 id=\"next-up\">Next up</h1>\n<p>We’ll be focusing on stability and bug-fixing to make sure everything feels great before starting on any new big projects.</p>\n<h1 id=\"talk-to-us\">Talk to us</h1>\n<p>If you want to get involved in shaping Moo.do’s direction, join our active <a href=\"/beta/\">beta community</a> or just <a href=\"mailto:support@moo.do\">email us</a>.</p>\n"}],"numPages":15,"path":"/blog/updates"}}
