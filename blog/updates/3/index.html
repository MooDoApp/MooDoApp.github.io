So now all of your documents and overviews are in one place.</p>\n<p>This has actually been in <a href=\"/beta/\">beta testing</a> for almost two months now, and was put on hold because we had to urgently switch gears to make <a href=\"/blog/chromeextension\">the chrome extension</a>. Our beta testers have said this change has made the Overview much more useful for them, so we’re very excited to finally release it to everyone!</p>\n<p>So just click on the hamburger icon at the top of a pane to open the new Overview, which will hopefully be more powerful for you now.</p>\n"},{"title":"Chrome Extension for Gmail","slug":"chromeextension","category":"updates","date":"Sat Apr 04 2020 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","contents":"<p>Due to Google’s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/elevating-user-trust-in-our-api-ecosystems\">new policies</a> requiring apps that sync with Gmail and Drive to undergo extremely expensive and time-consuming security assessments, we are shifting our email syncing strategy (for now). Moo.do is now going to integrate into Gmail, instead of integrating Gmail into Moo.do.</p>\n<h1 id=\"chrome-extension\">Chrome Extension</h1>\n<p>Our new Chrome extension adds a button to the top of Gmail to select a Moo.do document, which will add the selected email to the top of that document. It also adds a button to the Chrome toolbar to add a link to the current page into Moo.do. You can install it at <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moodo/dfphnckjoinkfflhfbnjoiggfflnekcb\">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moodo/dfphnckjoinkfflhfbnjoiggfflnekcb</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"gmail-add-on\">Gmail Add-On</h1>\n<p>Moo.do’s Gmail Add-On runs inside of Gmail in any browser, and even in the Gmail iOS and Android apps.

But in February they said it was all for nothing, the security assessment would in fact be required, and immediately unverified Moo.do. So we have been scrambling to get verified again and find a new solution for integrating with Gmail. This extension and Add-On are still very basic just to get something out as quickly as possible, and we will continue to improve them and add more features. If you have any requests or suggestions, please <a href=\"mailto:contact@moo.do\">let us know</a> or join our <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/beta\">beta community</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"up-next\">Up next</h1>\n<p>We’ve been stuck entirely focused on this for almost two months, so now we can go back to normal.

New users can create an account with either email/password or Google. And for those of you who already signed in with Google, you can now:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Link an email/password and sign in with either one</li>\n<li>Link email/password and then unlink from Google to just use email/password signin</li>\n<li>If you have email/password linked, you can unlink from Google and relink to easily change which Google account your Moo.do account is tied to (a common need when changing jobs)</li>\n<li>Ignore this and stick with Google signin</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: This is just a change to signin.

The boards inside that folder and all the documents contained within them will be copied into a template and you’ll be given a URL that you can share to use that template.</p>\n<p>If you’d like, you can embed these templates in blog posts describing your workflow, or you can simply share the template itself. In the future we’ll add a way to install templates into your account as well as view/install counting to create a dashboard of the most popular templates. For now, please let us know what else you’d like to see out of this Templates feature.</p>\n<p>Note: Templates are a copy of all of the documents in those boards that does not stay in sync. You can update the template by saving it again.</p>\n<h1 id=\"multiselect-drag-drop\">Multiselect drag/drop</h1>\n<p>This has been requested for a long time, and we’re very excited to have finally released it! You can now highlight multiple items and drag/drop of all of them at once.</p>\n<h1 id=\"custom-hotkeys\">Custom Hotkeys</h1>\n<p>This has also been requested for a long time! There is a new page in the Settings to customize your hotkeys, where you can modify existing hotkeys or add new ones.</p>\n<h1 id=\"demo-of-features\">Demo of Features</h1>\n<p>Using the new templates system, we’ve set up a live demo at <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/demo/\">https://www.moo.do/demo/</a>.
