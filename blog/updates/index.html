Some key highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved colors and contrast for readability, especially in Dark theme</li>\n<li>Spacing between items is increased for readability in the default ‚ÄúComfortable‚Äù theme while the ‚ÄúCompact‚Äù theme reduces spacing, closer to the old style.</li>\n<li>An updated pane header design moves all the view options (which are typically not changed often) into a single icon on the right side with the breadcrumbs on the left</li>\n<li>Added support for multiple sizes of headers defined by the number of <code>#</code> characters, which automatically shrink when indented in</li>\n<li>A new ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù feature to highlight any text with a blue background color</li>\n<li>Improved alignment of vertical lines with prefixes and collapsers</li>\n<li>Item links now display wrapped in <code>[[]]</code> characters instead of a background with icon. This feels more readable and is more in line with how other apps style item links.</li>\n<li>Panes are now flush with the background and only have a border between each other</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"theming\">Theming</h1>\n<img class=\"postImg\" src=\"/blog/img/theming-2.png\" width=\"600\" />\n\n<p>We‚Äôve made a css-like editor with (so far) 46 different themeable values. You can change all sorts of colors and spacings, and really anything you can do in CSS. On a basic level it shows all the default values with a color picker to edit them. If you want to get more advanced, you can add any CSS you want.</p>\n<p>The next step of this is to have a theme library with user-submitted themes in the future, and to start we have <a href=\"https://forum.legendapp.com/d/112-theme-showcase\">a thread in our new forum</a> to share your customizations. Once we get a good set of user themes in the showcase we can build them into the app so anyone can use them. We‚Äôre super excited about that!</p>\n<h1 id=\"check-out-the-forum\">Check out the forum</h1>\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://forum.legendapp.com/d/47-design-update\">all the people in our forum</a> who helped guide this in the right direction. If you‚Äôd like to report any bugs, request any features, or help test beta updates and guide their direction, please join us in the <a href=\"https://forum.legendapp.com\">forum</a> ‚ù§Ô∏è.</p>\n<style>\n.postImgTheming {\n    width: 800px;\n}\n</style>"},{"title":"Moo.do has become Legend!","slug":"legend","category":"updates","date":"Fri Jul 30 2021 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","contents":"<p>Moo.do is now known as Legend! Check out the <a href=\"https://legendapp.com\">new website</a> and the <a href=\"https://legendapp.com/blog/launch\">announcement</a>.</p>\n<p>We will continue to update Moo.do in parity with Legend for a while, but we encourage everyone to switch over to Legend at your earliest convenience. The mobile apps and extensions will be renamed to Legend in the coming weeks, so don‚Äôt be surprised if your Moo.do app suddenly has a new name!</p>\n"},{"title":"Item Mirrors","slug":"mirrors","category":"updates","date":"Mon Mar 22 2021 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","contents":"<p>Today we have this very highly requested new feature for you, which we‚Äôve been beta testing for a few weeks. Whereas Item Links insert a link to an item which can be clicked to zoom in, Item Mirrors directly embed the full item and its children. This lets you effectively put one item in multiple places. Since it is another instance of the same item, edits instantly appear in both places.</p>\n<p>This has transformed the way our beta testers use Moo.do as they can now create dashboards which show all their active projects, better manage dependencies, or group items together in different ways.</p>\n<p>To insert an item link, type <span class=\"hotkey\">((</span> to open an autocomplete to select the item to mirror. Or you can use drag/drop or the Move menu.</p>\n<h1 id=\"drag-drop-and-move\">Drag Drop and Move</h1>\n<p>Drag Drop and the Move menu have been significantly upgraded with new options. You can now press modifier keys (described in the bottom status bar) to copy, link, or mirror the items in addition to the normal move.</p>\n<h1 id=\"bug-fixes\">Bug fixes</h1>\n<p>We also have a lot of important bug fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Items with Google Calendar events now sync with their calendar representations immediately</li>\n<li>Agenda views were hiding overdue google calendar items even if created in the current document</li>\n<li>Enter was not working while search was open</li>\n<li>Indenting in grouped views was losing selection</li>\n<li>Better handling of plugin sync errors</li>\n<li>Boards‚Äô conflict resolution while syncing offline changes works better</li>\n<li>When calendar pane is small, view mode buttons now change to a single button with a menu instead of just disappearing</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"title":"Mobile Gmail Support","slug":"mobile-gmail","category":"updates","date":"Mon Feb 22 2021 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","contents":"<p>The iOS and Android apps now support syncing with Gmail! The mobile apps can sync multiple accounts and multiple labels, just like the desktop app. This is great for managing emails on the go - just press and hold an email to drag it to the clipboard at the bottom of the screen, then switch to another pane and drag it to your lists.</p>\n<p>The mobile app will use the same accounts that you have set up in the ‚ÄúSync Plugins‚Äù section of the desktop app. See <a href=\"/blog/email-is-back\">the desktop email announcement</a> for more details if you haven‚Äôt started syncing your email accounts already.</p>\n<p>If you don‚Äôt already have an Email pane in your mobile app, you can add it to the Mobile board in the desktop version.</p>\n<p>This feature has been in beta testing for a few weeks, but it‚Äôs still new so if you run into any issues or have any requests please <a href=\"mailto:contact@moo.do\">let us know</a> or join our <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/beta\">beta community</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to mobile email, we‚Äôve also made some other big improvements over the last month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-history\">Version History</h2>\n<p>The Version History is now fully featured. It now renders items normally, shows only changed items by default, groups similar changes together, and has buttons to restore to the previous state. You can restore a whole chunk at a time or select one or a few changes to restore. Or you can just highlight and copy to paste elsewhere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pane-footer\">Pane Footer</h2>\n<p>There is now a footer at the bottom of each pane that shows references of the zoomed item, if it is linked to from elsewhere. Clicking them zooms the pane to the linking item‚Äôs parent and scrolls the linking item in view.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pane-status-bar\">Pane Status Bar</h2>\n<p>There‚Äôs also a status bar at the bottom of the screen showing statistics of the number of items in view, along with character and word counts. You can enable/disable it in the General section of the settings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiple-windows\">Multiple Windows</h2>\n<p>The desktop apps now support multiple windows. Use <span class=\"hotkey\">Cmd + Shift + N</span> on Mac or <span class=\"hotkey\">Ctrl + Shift + N</span> on Windows or the ‚ÄúOpen New Window‚Äù option in the File menu. It will save the selected board and window position for each window independently.</p>\n<h2 id=\"miscellaneous\">Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Editing in the mobile apps works much better</li>\n<li>The browser version of Moo.do now supports printing, putting each pane in a board on its own page.</li>\n<li>It‚Äôs now much easier to link to local files in the desktop app. When you drag a file onto Moo.do it will let you choose between linking a local file or uploading to Drive.</li>\n<li>The heading of a zoomed item is now editable</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"title":"Outlook Email Support","slug":"outlook","category":"updates","date":"Fri Jan 15 2021 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","contents":"<p>Moo.do now supports syncing emails with Outlook email on both personal and 365 accounts. It works similarly to the new <a href=\"/blog/email-is-back\">Gmail integration</a> - just add your accounts in the ‚ÄúSync Plugins‚Äù section of the settings. Then they will be available in the Email pane as well as for composing new emails.</p>\n<p>Like the new Gmail integration, this is only available in the <a href=\"/download/\">desktop app</a>, but the web version will show emails saved to documents and open outlook.com on click. The mobile apps can now open saved Outlook emails in-app.</p>\n<h1 id=\"chrome-extension-and-gmail-add-on\">Chrome Extension and Gmail Add-On</h1>\n<p>The Moo.do Chrome Extension now supports saving multiple emails at once in Gmail and both it and the Gmail Add-On have reduced the amount of email content they need to save.</p>\n<h1 id=\"get-started\">Get started</h1>\n<p>The desktop apps should update themselves, but if they don‚Äôt or you want to download it, you can get it at <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/download/\">https://www.moo.do/download</a>. The mobile apps will also update themselves to add support for opening Outlook emails in-app.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-s-next\">What‚Äôs next</h1>\n<p>Full Gmail and Outlook sync on mobile is the next project on our todo list. But we‚Äôre also taking some time to work on bugs and small features.
