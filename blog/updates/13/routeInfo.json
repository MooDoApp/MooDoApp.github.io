As all modern apps should be, <strong>Moo.do</strong> is available on any computer, tablet, or phone and synchronizes all devices and users in realtime.</p>\n<p>Throughout the development process we have been using <strong>Moo.do</strong> as our only tool for <a href=\"/blog/public-beta\">planning, bug tracking, scheduling, and release tracking</a>. At the same time we have been using it to manage other projects, travel plans, and our day-to-day lives. Many of our beta testers have switched to using <strong>Moo.do</strong> as their primary organization system. Today we are happy to bring the power and simplicity of <strong>Moo.do</strong> to everyone.</p>\n<p>As of today <strong>Moo.do</strong> is accessible on the iOS, Android, and Chrome App Stores and as a full-featured web app at <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/\">https://moo.do</a>. Apps for Windows Phone, Windows 8, and Mac OS X will follow shortly.</p>\n<p>We hope that <strong>Moo.do</strong> will help you organize your life and keep you on track.
