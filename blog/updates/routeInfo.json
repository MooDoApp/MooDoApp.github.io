Whereas Item Links insert a link to an item which can be clicked to zoom in, Item Mirrors directly embed the full item and its children. This lets you effectively put one item in multiple places. Since it is another instance of the same item, edits instantly appear in both places.</p>\n<p>This has transformed the way our beta testers use Moo.do as they can now create dashboards which show all their active projects, better manage dependencies, or group items together in different ways.</p>\n<p>To insert an item link, type <span class=\"hotkey\">((</span> to open an autocomplete to select the item to mirror. Or you can use drag/drop or the Move menu.</p>\n<h1 id=\"drag-drop-and-move\">Drag Drop and Move</h1>\n<p>Drag Drop and the Move menu have been significantly upgraded with new options. You can now press modifier keys (described in the bottom status bar) to copy, link, or mirror the items in addition to the normal move.</p>\n<h1 id=\"bug-fixes\">Bug fixes</h1>\n<p>We also have a lot of important bug fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Items with Google Calendar events now sync with their calendar representations immediately</li>\n<li>Agenda views were hiding overdue google calendar items even if created in the current document</li>\n<li>Enter was not working while search was open</li>\n<li>Indenting in grouped views was losing selection</li>\n<li>Better handling of plugin sync errors</li>\n<li>Boards’ conflict resolution while syncing offline changes works better</li>\n<li>When calendar pane is small, view mode buttons now change to a single button with a menu instead of just disappearing</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"title":"Mobile Gmail Support","slug":"mobile-gmail","category":"updates","date":"Mon Feb 22 2021 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","contents":"<p>The iOS and Android apps now support syncing with Gmail! The mobile apps can sync multiple accounts and multiple labels, just like the desktop app. This is great for managing emails on the go - just press and hold an email to drag it to the clipboard at the bottom of the screen, then switch to another pane and drag it to your lists.</p>\n<p>The mobile app will use the same accounts that you have set up in the “Sync Plugins” section of the desktop app. See <a href=\"/blog/email-is-back\">the desktop email announcement</a> for more details if you haven’t started syncing your email accounts already.</p>\n<p>If you don’t already have an Email pane in your mobile app, you can add it to the Mobile board in the desktop version.</p>\n<p>This feature has been in beta testing for a few weeks, but it’s still new so if you run into any issues or have any requests please <a href=\"mailto:contact@moo.do\">let us know</a> or join our <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/beta\">beta community</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to mobile email, we’ve also made some other big improvements over the last month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-history\">Version History</h2>\n<p>The Version History is now fully featured. It now renders items normally, shows only changed items by default, groups similar changes together, and has buttons to restore to the previous state. You can restore a whole chunk at a time or select one or a few changes to restore. Or you can just highlight and copy to paste elsewhere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pane-footer\">Pane Footer</h2>\n<p>There is now a footer at the bottom of each pane that shows references of the zoomed item, if it is linked to from elsewhere. Clicking them zooms the pane to the linking item’s parent and scrolls the linking item in view.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pane-status-bar\">Pane Status Bar</h2>\n<p>There’s also a status bar at the bottom of the screen showing statistics of the number of items in view, along with character and word counts. You can enable/disable it in the General section of the settings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiple-windows\">Multiple Windows</h2>\n<p>The desktop apps now support multiple windows. Use <span class=\"hotkey\">Cmd + Shift + N</span> on Mac or <span class=\"hotkey\">Ctrl + Shift + N</span> on Windows or the “Open New Window” option in the File menu. It will save the selected board and window position for each window independently.</p>\n<h2 id=\"miscellaneous\">Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Editing in the mobile apps works much better</li>\n<li>The browser version of Moo.do now supports printing, putting each pane in a board on its own page.</li>\n<li>It’s now much easier to link to local files in the desktop app. When you drag a file onto Moo.do it will let you choose between linking a local file or uploading to Drive.</li>\n<li>The heading of a zoomed item is now editable</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"title":"Outlook Email Support","slug":"outlook","category":"updates","date":"Fri Jan 15 2021 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","contents":"<p>Moo.do now supports syncing emails with Outlook email on both personal and 365 accounts. It works similarly to the new <a href=\"/blog/email-is-back\">Gmail integration</a> - just add your accounts in the “Sync Plugins” section of the settings. Then they will be available in the Email pane as well as for composing new emails.</p>\n<p>Like the new Gmail integration, this is only available in the <a href=\"/download/\">desktop app</a>, but the web version will show emails saved to documents and open outlook.com on click. The mobile apps can now open saved Outlook emails in-app.</p>\n<h1 id=\"chrome-extension-and-gmail-add-on\">Chrome Extension and Gmail Add-On</h1>\n<p>The Moo.do Chrome Extension now supports saving multiple emails at once in Gmail and both it and the Gmail Add-On have reduced the amount of email content they need to save.</p>\n<h1 id=\"get-started\">Get started</h1>\n<p>The desktop apps should update themselves, but if they don’t or you want to download it, you can get it at <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/download/\">https://www.moo.do/download</a>.

Moo.do’s email features are back in full force! We had to remove our Gmail sync <a href=\"/blog/chromeextension\">back in April</a> due to a change in Google’s policies, but we now have a new way to sync with Gmail that’s even better than it was before.</p>\n<p>Moo.do now does a full sync with Gmail in the new Email Pane (renamed from Inbox) which can pull in multiple Gmail accounts and has a unified All Accounts inbox. You can now reply to and forward your emails, and compose emails with any of your linked Gmail accounts. You can star, archive, and delete your emails right in Moo.do so you don’t need to switch apps. Moo.do now displays and composes emails using Gmail itself so it’s full-featured and familiar. Emails saved by the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moodo/dfphnckjoinkfflhfbnjoiggfflnekcb\">Chrome extension</a> or <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/moodo/597847337936\">Gmail Add-On</a> will be listed under the Saved label in the Email Pane.</p>\n<p>The only downside is that Gmail sync does not work in the web version and requires the <a href=\"/download/\">desktop app</a>, but the web version’s Email Pane displays emails saved by the extension or add-on, and any emails saved into your documents will display correctly and open a Gmail tab on click.</p>\n<p>We believe it will be possible to add full sync with the mobile app and we will work on that next, but for now the mobile app has been updated to open emails using an embedded instance of Gmail, which is a better experience than our previous read-only preview and opening Gmail in a browser.</p>\n<h1 id=\"get-started\">Get started</h1>\n<p>The desktop apps should update themselves, but if they don’t or you want to download it, you can get it at <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/download/\">https://www.moo.do/download</a>. To get started with this new Gmail integration, open the Sync Plugins section of the settings and add your accounts to the new Gmail Accounts list at the top, then add an Email Pane.</p>\n<h1 id=\"want-outlook-support-\">Want Outlook support?</h1>\n<p>We may also be able to support sync with outlook.com using a similar method. If that is something you want, please let us know in our <a href=\"/beta/\">beta community</a> or <a href=\"mailto:support@moo.do\">email us</a>.</p>\n"}],"numPages":16,"path":"/blog/updates"}}
