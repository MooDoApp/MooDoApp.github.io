There are small tweaks all over the app but the most notable changes are:</p>\n<p></p>\n- **Top buttons moved into a sidebar.** This makes it clearer what the buttons do and we think it’s prettier :). Toggle the sidebar with **Cmd + Option + S** on Mac and **Ctrl + Shift + I** on Windows or Linux, and you can still access the buttons by hotkey.\n- **Rearranged pane header.** The titles are on the first row and search is on the second row, with the search box and filters split to make them more distinct.\n- **Improved workspace switching.** Open the boards menu with **<span class=\"hotkeySec\">Ctrl</span> + B** and use the arrow keys to switch between them.\n- **Many icon changes.** We switched many old icons for newer, prettier icons from the Material Design icon set.\n\n<img class=\"postImg postImgUpdateDesign\" src=\"/blog/img/update-design.png\" />\n\n<h1 id=\"help-us-improve\">Help us improve</h1>\n<p>As always, please let us know if you find any issues or how we can make our apps better for you.
