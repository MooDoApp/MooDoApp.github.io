Now that they’re done, we’re taking a break from big projects to focus on stability and improving the quality of our current features. In the past month we’ve fixed a ton of bugs and we’ve been <a href=\"/beta\">beta testing</a> a change to the layout of the pane header along with new ways of grouping and sorting your data.</p>\n<h1 id=\"pane-design-and-features\">Pane Design and Features</h1>\n<img class=\"postImg postImgPane\" src=\"/blog/img/update-pane-design.png\" />\n\n<p>We’ve rearranged the pane header and menus to be more intuitive. The top row of the header now prominently displays the document name and the name of the item you’re zoomed into, with the breadcrumb path lightly displayed above it. The bottom row has a button for setting up the pane view options and a full width search bar.</p>\n<p>The pane view options bring new possibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Created and Completed grouping/sort modes are now top level options. They were previously sort modes under the Agenda view.</li>\n<li>You can now group and sort by modified time.</li>\n<li>All of the groupings and sorts can now be viewed as a “List” view, which shows only the items that match the search with no hierarchy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"improved-search\">Improved search</h1>\n<p>Along with the new groupings and sort modes, search has new features to make it more powerful.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quoted phrase search like <code>word1 &quot;quoted phrase&quot; -&quot;hide phrase&quot;</code></li>\n<li>Search for <code>*</code> to match starred items, <code>!!!</code> to match priority items, <code>^</code> or <code>#</code> to match projects</li>\n<li>Search for <code>date:today+&lt;num&gt;</code> to show items <code>&lt;num&gt;</code> days from today</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Combining these new search features with “or” searches can make for some really powerful filtering!</p>\n<h1 id=\"miscellaneous\">Miscellaneous</h1>\n<p>We’ve also been fixing bugs and adding little features that our users have requested. See <a href=\"/changelog\">the changelog</a> for a full rundown of all the fixes/features.</p>\n<p>If there’s any particular bug that’s been bothering you or a feature that could really help you, please let us know! The best way to do that is to join our <a href=\"/beta\">beta community</a> or just <a href=\"mailto:support@moo.do\">email us</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"next-up\">Next up</h1>\n<p>We’ll be continuing to focus on stability and bug-fixing to make sure everything is rock solid before we start on any new big projects.</p>\n<style>\n.postImgPane {\n    width: 500px;\n}\n</style>"}],"isSinglePost":true}}
