We’ve been hard at work on building a brand new mobile app from scratch. After 6 months, 51 beta updates, and with the help of 72 patient beta testers, it’s finally ready for full release!</p>\n<p>For this first version of the new mobile app we focused on reimplementing the existing features and design, but in a much higher quality package. So it looks and works mostly the same as the old version but is faster, smoother, and less buggy. From here we can make it even faster, rethink the design, and quickly add lots of new features.\n<br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moo.do-organize-your-way/id889830074?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">Download iOS App</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moo.do\">Download Android</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"what-s-new\">What’s New</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Faster load time</li>\n<li>Smoother interaction</li>\n<li>Better and less buggy typing experience</li>\n<li>Supports editing of text in items with dates, emails, or files</li>\n<li>Swipe menus are more intuitive</li>\n<li>Emails are sized to fit the screen and support zooming</li>\n<li>Overall less buggy</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"web-desktop-changes\">Web / Desktop Changes</h1>\n<p>We’ve been pretty quiet on the blog here because we’ve been working on this huge project for so long. But we have released some important features and fixes along the way. You can see the <a href=\"/changelog/\">changelog</a> for the full details of all the updates, but here are the major changes from the past few months:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of improvements to sync stability, calendar views, and copy/paste</li>\n<li>The add item popup now has document and calendar selectors</li>\n<li>Sharing a document with a non-Moo.do user will send an email inviting them to collaborate on the document</li>\n<li>A new view for Deleted Items to browse and undelete them</li>\n<li>A maximize button on the email compose window</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"technical-details\">Technical Details</h1>\n<p>The previous app was a mobile web app in a native wrapper. It was generally fine, but there were some editing bugs that were impossible to solve within the constraints of a mobile web app. So we built the new app in React Native, which allowed us to reuse much of the same code, although we had to rebuild the user interface and a lot of the app’s core from scratch. And along the way we also converted the whole codebase to TypeScript and ES2018, so it is much cleaner and easier to extend.</p>\n<h1 id=\"next-up\">Next up</h1>\n<p>We’ll be focusing on stability and bug-fixing to make sure everything feels great before starting on any new big projects.</p>\n<h1 id=\"talk-to-us\">Talk to us</h1>\n<p>If you want to get involved in shaping Moo.do’s direction, join our active <a href=\"/beta/\">beta community</a> or just <a href=\"mailto:support@moo.do\">email us</a>.</p>\n"},{"title":"Save to local files","slug":"local-files","category":"updates","date":"Tue Jan 29 2019 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)","contents":"<p>First off, thank you to everyone for bearing with us through the migration to the new backend which wasn’t quite as smooth as we had hoped. We’ve fixed the majority of the bugs and missing features since the release, but if you still have any issues reach out to us at <a href=\"mailto:support@moo.do\">support@moo.do</a> or in the <a href=\"/beta/\">Slack group</a>.</p>\n<p>Now let’s get into the updates!</p>\n<h1 id=\"local-documents-beta-\">Local documents (beta)</h1>\n<p>The desktop app has a new feature to store documents on your computer that do not sync with the server. It saves your documents as .json files into a folder of your choosing (see the new “Desktop App” section in the Settings). Moo.do watches the files and reacts to changes instantly, so you can reliably sync the Moo.do folder with your own sync/backup system if you’d like.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> this is an option in addition to the normal sync system, which is not going away.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p> This has some important benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For the privacy focused</strong>: Moo.do’s encryption options make syncing with our database very secure, but not syncing at all is even more secure.</li>\n<li><strong>For networks that block Google</strong>: Sync the Moo.do folder with your preferred sync service.</li>\n<li><strong>For the hackers</strong>: You control the data so you can read and change it outside of Moo.do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And one big downside:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Documents not available elsewhere</strong>: The mobile and web apps can only see documents that are synced with Moo.do.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n\n<p>To get started working with local documents, get the latest version (1.3.0) of the desktop app. It should update itself, or you can <a href=\"/download\">download it here</a>. Then when you click the + button in the document list to add a new button, you’ll see a menu to choose local or synced.</p>\n<p>We’re calling the local documents feature a beta because there’s a lot more we want to do with it. When fully finished Moo.do will be able to function without signing in at all by syncing boards and settings as files too. We’d also like to add other niceties like multiple storage locations and saving files in a Markdown format. And let us know if there’s anything else you’d like from local documents support.</p>\n<h1 id=\"lots-of-fixes\">Lots of fixes</h1>\n<p>We’ve been focusing on fixing bugs and making everything very stable since the new backend release last month. The highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automated cloud backups and new revision history system, and the desktop app does local backups</li>\n<li>Fixed emails stuck loading in Mailbird</li>\n<li>New plugin caching system that improves load time and fixes many email and calendar bugs</li>\n<li>Change or remove encryption password</li>\n<li>Sort the list of documents alphabetically or by last modified</li>\n<li>Repeat dates show every single instance on the calendar</li>\n<li>Repeat dates can recur from their completion date</li>\n<li>Images show as uploading until they’re done</li>\n<li>Fixed images were sometimes not loading</li>\n<li>Notifications work much better</li>\n<li>Fixed downloading attachments and opening links from the desktop apps</li>\n<li>Paste of a lot of items is much faster</li>\n<li>New settings for enabling plugins per account</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the <a href=\"/changelog/\">changelog</a> for the full list of changes.</p>\n<h1 id=\"next-up\">Next up</h1>\n<p>We’re now working on building new mobile apps, and of course continuing with bug fixing.</p>\n<h1 id=\"talk-to-us\">Talk to us</h1>\n<p>If you want to get involved in shaping Moo.do’s direction, join our active <a href=\"/beta/\">beta community</a> or just <a href=\"mailto:support@moo.do\">email us</a>.</p>\n"},{"title":"New backend","slug":"new-backend","category":"updates","date":"Fri Dec 07 2018 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)","contents":"<p>The new backend is ready! It’s been a long time coming and we’re very excited about the improved performance, new features, and future possibilities it opens up. If you have any issues with the new version or any suggestions to improve it, please join our <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/beta/\">beta community</a> or email <a href=\"mailto:support@moo.do\">support</a>.</p>\n<p>The old backend will stop syncing on December 11. You can still access it at <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/old/\">https://www.moo.do/old/</a> to copy your data out of it, but it won’t sync with your collaborators or other devices anymore.</p>\n<h1 id=\"get-into-it\">Get into it</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The desktop apps should update themselves, or you can download the new version at <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/download\">https://www.moo.do/download</a>.</li>\n<li>The web apps at <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/web/\">https://www.moo.do/web/</a> will update themselves, or you may need to refresh once or twice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please make sure to click the <b>Import from Moo.do</b> button on the Welcome screen to copy your Premium account information, documents, and settings over.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-major-changes\">The Major Changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"storage-and-sync\">Storage and sync</h2>\n<p>Documents are now stored and synced with Firebase instead of your Drive account. When you load the page it now only gets new changes since the last sync, so the initial sync on load will be much faster. Our beta testers have reported that the connection is much more stable than before. And there’s no longer a maximum document size.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiple-documents\">Multiple documents</h2>\n<p>Each pane can now contain its own document. The pane sidebar that was the overview is now doing double duty as a document selector. Click the <img class=\"mobile-icon\" src=\"/blog/img/icon-overview.png\" /> at the top left of a pane to choose the document for that pane, and click the outline icon on the document to open its overview.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dates\">Dates</h2>\n<p>Dates are now stored separately from the text so that we can add more date features without cluttering the text. The key for adding dates to items is now <b>!</b> so that <b>@</b> can be used for a future assigning tasks feature. Adding dates now opens a popup where you can select a date on a calendar or type the date in text. This new system will let us add more date features in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"encryption\">Encryption</h2>\n<p>All items are encrypted client-side before sending them to the database, and you can add an additional layer of security by using your own encryption password. You will be prompted to (optionally) set a password during the introduction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"plugin-authorization\">Plugin authorization</h2>\n<p>We totally rewrote the way we authenticate plugins which should fix any sync issues you might have seen before.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sharing\">Sharing</h2>\n<p>We have a totally new sharing system, so you will need to re-share any documents you had shared in the old system. Shared documents can now be encrypted individually for extra security. Right click on a document and select Share from the menu share it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"known-issues\">Known issues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Enabling plugins with multiple accounts causes reauthorize messages for each account, but after reauthorizing everything works</li>\n<li>Undo/redo may be slightly buggy</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"next-up\">Next up</h1>\n<p>There’s still a few features missing in the new version that we will add within the next couple of weeks such as email snoozing. And we will be focusing on fixing bugs and making sure that this new version is very stable. Then the next project is to finish the new mobile apps.</p>\n<h1 id=\"talk-to-us\">Talk to us</h1>\n<p>If you want to get involved in shaping Moo.do’s direction, please join our active <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/beta/\">beta community</a>, or just <a href=\"mailto:support@moo.do\">email us</a>.</p>\n<style>\n.mobile-icon {\n    width: 24px;\n    height: 24px;\n    vertical-align: top;\n}\n</style>"},{"title":"New mobile apps and backend coming","slug":"mobile-backend-coming","category":"updates","date":"Sun Sep 02 2018 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","contents":"<p>You may have noticed updates have slowed from our normal daily clip, and that’s because we’ve got some big projects in the works.</p>\n<h1 id=\"new-backend\">New backend</h1>\n<p>Moo.do currently uses the Google Drive Realtime API as its backend, which was great for letting us get up and running with realtime collaboration quickly, but it comes with many downsides. The biggest downside is that Google is shutting it down in December. So we are working on a new backend which will be faster and more flexible.</p>\n<p>One of our favorite things about storing data in Google Drive is the privacy benefit that nobody (including us) is able to access your data. Privacy is still very important to us, so we’re approaching privacy in a different (and better) way: end to end encryption. Your data will always be encrypted before saving to the database, and you’ll be able to password encrypt your data so that nobody can ever read it. We’re also adding support for working with local files, which entirely avoids any privacy issues with syncing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-the-new-backend\">Benefits of the new backend</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple simultaneous documents - each pane can view a different document</li>\n<li>Faster load/sync time</li>\n<li>End to end encryption</li>\n<li>Easier and more flexible sharing</li>\n<li>Undo/redo works offline</li>\n<li>Not tied to a Google account</li>\n<li>Support opening local files on your computer</li>\n<li>No maximum document size</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"potential-new-features-possible-with-the-new-backend\">Potential new features possible with the new backend</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Public API for accessing and adding to documents</li>\n<li>Browser extensions for saving links</li>\n<li>Plugins in other apps (Slack, Gmail, etc…)</li>\n<li>Features for teams (manage users in a team, assign tasks, billing for teams, etc…)</li>\n<li>Realtime chat</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"new-mobile-apps\">New mobile apps</h1>\n<p>The one thing we hear most from our users is that the mobile apps are really bad, and we totally agree. We had been focusing on making the web/desktop apps great and have let the mobile experience fall short. Rather than investing time in upgrading the current app to use the new backend, we’ve started on a fresh new app. The major problems are unfixable in the current app, so we’re making a new one from scratch. The new apps will be much faster and smoother, will fix a lot of the existing bugs, and we’ll be able to more quickly improve the user interface and bring over the features from the desktop apps.</p>\n<h1 id=\"technical-details\">Technical details</h1>\n<p><strong>Current backend:</strong> Data is stored and synced in your Google Drive account with the Drive Realtime API. Sharing is done through Drive’s sharing system. The mobile apps are wrappers around web views (WKWebView on iOS and Crosswalk on Android), with custom native code for native features like notifications and authentication.</p>\n<p><strong>New backend:</strong> Data is stored and synced data with a combination of Google Firebase and Google Cloud Storage, and data is encrypted client-side before sending it to the database. Sharing is done using Firebase’s security rules. The new mobile apps are built with React Native and share a majority of the code with the web/desktop apps, but have their own unique user interfaces.</p>\n<h1 id=\"status\">Status</h1>\n<p>We’re already quite far along with getting the basics working and we’re aiming to start beta testing in about a month. We’ll post another update when it’s ready.</p>\n"},{"title":"Images","slug":"images","category":"updates","date":"Tue Jul 03 2018 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","image":"/blog/img/update-images-1.png","contents":"<p>Moo.do now has full support for inline images: for links to online images, images in your Google Drive, and images uploaded from your computer.
