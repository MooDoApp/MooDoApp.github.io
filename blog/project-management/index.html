Our goal is to allow anyone to organize in a way that makes the most sense for them. If you&#39;re interested in how Moo.do can solve different organization problems, we will be posting examples of how different people and teams are using Moo.do.

To start off I&#39;m going to talk about how we&#39;ve been using Moo.do to manage its own development. We have spent a majority of the development process working remotely and in vastly different time zones, so making sure we know what to work on next without additional communication is especially important.



We found traditional systems for project management and bug tracking to be too heavy. We wasted our time fighting software and waiting for pages to load, so we designed Moo.do to be a powerful tool for managing a project and tracking its bugs while taking a content first approach with a minimalist UI. At Moo.do, we use our own product to organize everything about itself: features, bugs, ideas, marketing, and feedback. Today I&#39;ll focus on how we manage feature planning, bugs, and managing product ideas.

If you&#39;re interested in how <strong>Moo.do</strong> can solve different organization problems, we will be posting <a href="/blog/ideas">examples of how different people and teams are using <strong>Moo.do</strong></a>.</p><p>To start off I&#39;m going to talk about how we&#39;ve been using <strong>Moo.do</strong> to manage its own development. We have spent a majority of the development process working remotely and in vastly different time zones, so making sure we know what to work on next without additional communication is especially important.</p><p>We found traditional systems for project management and bug tracking to be too heavy. We wasted our time fighting software and waiting for pages to load, so we designed <strong>Moo.do</strong> to be a powerful tool for managing a project and tracking its bugs while taking a content first approach with a minimalist UI. At <strong>Moo.do</strong>, we use our own product to organize everything about itself: features, bugs, ideas, marketing, and feedback. Today I&#39;ll focus on how we manage feature planning, bugs, and managing product ideas.</p><h1>Organization</h1><p>At the beginning of a milestone, we discuss the main goals we want to accomplish and lay out a basic plan separated into distinct groups.</p><div id="demoOrganization" class="demo"></div><p>As we progress through the milestone, we mark tasks complete and add new bugs under Major and Minor Bugs. At the end of a milestone, we drag and drop tasks that did not get completed into the next release, and discuss what features and bugs from Future we want to bring in. Then we mark the current release complete and move onto the next one.</p><h1>Prioritizing and Flagging</h1><p>We use the three priority levels in <strong>Moo.do</strong> to describe how soon we should deal with tasks. For us, <span class="p0">high priority</span> means that it should be handled immediately, while <span class="p1">lower priorities</span> are more important than most things, but can wait. We use <span class="pFlag">flagging to highlight things</span> for the other person to look at.</p><p>When I look over what to do for the day, I mark what tasks I&#39;m planning to do today as <span class="p0">high priority</span> to make them easy to find. Grant prefers to prioritize based on severity, marking the scariest bugs as <span class="p0">high priority</span> so he&#39;ll keep thinking about them.</p><h1>Tagging</h1><p>We use tags to assign tasks, group related tasks together, or mark for future action.</p><table class="tagsList"><tr><td>#Grant</td><td>Assigned to Grant</td></tr><tr><td>#J</td><td>Assigned to Jay</td></tr><tr><td>#Discuss</td><td>To discuss in our next phone call</td></tr><tr><td>#punt</td><td>Delay until the next milestone</td></tr><tr><td>#watch</td><td>Bug that's hard to reproduce - keep an eye on it</td></tr></table><h1>Searching</h1><p>This is where Moo.do is incredibly powerful. Between all the features, bugs, ideas, marketing plans, and user feedback, we have thousands of lines of data. Search lets us focus on what&#39;s important right now.</p><ul><li>We can start a search with <span class="search">-</span> to hide irrelevant items, and we can combine that with <span class="search">//</span>, the search shorthand for &#39;complete,&#39; to hide completed items.</li><li>We search for <span class="search">-// -<span class="tag">#punt</span></span> to hide all completed and postponed tasks.</li><li>If I want to see everything assigned to me, I search for <span class="search"><span class="tag">#J</span></span></li><li>To see my todo list for the day, I search for <span class="search"><span class="tag">#J</span><span class="p0 b">!!</span></span> to show only tasks assigned to me of at least medium priority.</li><li>When we get on the phone we both search for <span class="search"><span class="tag">#Discuss</span></span> and go down the list together.</li></ul><h1>Multiple Panes</h1><p>It is often quite useful to look at the same data in different ways. A nice way to use search in <strong>Moo.do</strong> is to have multiple panes open with different searches. Hiding completed and punted tasks shows what&#39;s left.</p><div id="demoPanes1" class="demo"></div><div class="caption noMobile">This is a fully interactive instance of <b>Moo.do</b>. Try your own searches like <span class="search">-//</span> or <span class="search"><span class="p0 b">!!!</span></span>.</div><p>I like to use <strong>Moo.do</strong> full-screen with three panes open at once:</p><ul><li>Searched for <span class="search">-// -<span class="tag">#punt</span></span> as shown above. This is where I add, edit, and assign features or bugs. I can add to the current release or scroll down and add them to the next one.</li><li>Focused on this release and searched for <span class="search">-// -<span class="tag">#punt #J</span></span> to see my tasks.</li><li>Focused on this release and searched for <span class="search">-// -<span class="tag">#punt #J</span><span class="p0 b">!!</span></span> which is my todo list for the day.</li></ul><div id="demoPanes2" class="demo"></div><div class="caption noMobile">This is a fully interactive instance of <b>Moo.do</b>. Try your own searches like <span class="search"><span class="tag">#Grant</span></span> to see Grant's tasks.</div><h1>Progress Tracking</h1><p><strong>Moo.do</strong> keeps track of when items are completed, which has a variety of uses for project management.</p><ul><li>When I start work for the day, I can see what Grant finished the day before.</li><li>When I finish a day&#39;s work, I like to look over what I got done.</li><li>We can look through the past couple of weeks and get a feel for how quickly we&#39;re moving.</li></ul><div id="demoAgenda" class="demo"></div><h1>Discussion</h1><p>In some cases we want to add more information to a task, or I want to ask a question on a task Grant added. To add details to a bug or feature, ask questions, add steps to reproduce a bug, or request a code review, we add a sub-item assigned to the other person with a tag, and flag it to make it stand out. We often have short conversations as we try to reproduce a bug.</p><div id="demoDiscussion" class="demo"></div><p>If you would like to see tips for how to organize your particular set of content, or have an interesting organization method that you use, send us an email at <a href="mailto:contact@moo.do"> contact@moo.do</a>. We&#39;d love to hear about what you do now or how you stay organized with <strong>Moo.do</strong>. Check back soon for more case studies.</p><script>
