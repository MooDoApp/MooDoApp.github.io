Google Calendar is a Premium plugin and it is also available as a free trial to our Community Members (anyone who has invited 5 or more people).

We are very excited to enable access to Google Calendar from Moo.do as this seamlessly integrates Moo.do with every calendar app out there. Moo.do and Google Calendar synchronize in both directions, meaning you can manage your calendar with Moo.do as well as work with your Moo.do events from your favorite Calendar app.

This has been the most requested feature on our feature requests page and through our in-app feedback. Thank you to everyone who is helping to keep us pointed in the right direction to make everybody happier and more productive.

Let&#39;s get into how Moo.do&#39;s Google Calendar plugin works:

Choose your calendars

Select all of the calendars you want to sync from and the one you want to sync to.



Calendar events in the agenda

Your Google Calendar events are in your Agenda, marked by a  icon. You can edit existing events and add new events in the Agenda or you can drag them onto your lists. Use the  button in the search box to show or hide Calendar events.


Sync your events

Press Ctrl + C on an item with a @date and the event gets added to your calendar, with a  icon to show you that it&#39;s synced. We don&#39;t want to fill your calendar by automatically adding every @date item, but if you want to add many events to your calendar in bulk, you can highlight multiple items and press Ctrl + C to add them all at once.

Edit events anywhere, anytime

Moo.do syncs both ways, so you can edit events in Moo.do or in your calendar and they&#39;ll stay in sync everywhere. You can also add or modify events while offline and they will sync when you go back online.

Durations

We&#39;ve added support for durations for Calendar events. You can add an event with a duration formatted in many different ways.


Help us improve

This is an Early Access release, meaning we want your feedback to get this feature right. Please let us know how you use your calendar with Moo.do and how we can make this integration better. We put a a feedback form in the Early Access section of the settings. Thank you!
