The mobile apps can sync multiple accounts and multiple labels, just like the desktop app. This is great for managing emails on the go - just press and hold an email to drag it to the clipboard at the bottom of the screen, then switch to another pane and drag it to your lists.</p>\n<p>The mobile app will use the same accounts that you have set up in the “Sync Plugins” section of the desktop app. See <a href=\"/blog/email-is-back\">the desktop email announcement</a> for more details if you haven’t started syncing your email accounts already.</p>\n<p>If you don’t already have an Email pane in your mobile app, you can add it to the Mobile board in the desktop version.</p>\n<p>This feature has been in beta testing for a few weeks, but it’s still new so if you run into any issues or have any requests please <a href=\"mailto:contact@moo.do\">let us know</a> or join our <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/beta\">beta community</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to mobile email, we’ve also made some other big improvements over the last month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-history\">Version History</h2>\n<p>The Version History is now fully featured. It now renders items normally, shows only changed items by default, groups similar changes together, and has buttons to restore to the previous state. You can restore a whole chunk at a time or select one or a few changes to restore. Or you can just highlight and copy to paste elsewhere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pane-footer\">Pane Footer</h2>\n<p>There is now a footer at the bottom of each pane that shows references of the zoomed item, if it is linked to from elsewhere. Clicking them zooms the pane to the linking item’s parent and scrolls the linking item in view.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pane-status-bar\">Pane Status Bar</h2>\n<p>There’s also a status bar at the bottom of the screen showing statistics of the number of items in view, along with character and word counts. You can enable/disable it in the General section of the settings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiple-windows\">Multiple Windows</h2>\n<p>The desktop apps now support multiple windows. Use <span class=\"hotkey\">Cmd + Shift + N</span> on Mac or <span class=\"hotkey\">Ctrl + Shift + N</span> on Windows or the “Open New Window” option in the File menu. It will save the selected board and window position for each window independently.</p>\n<h2 id=\"miscellaneous\">Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Editing in the mobile apps works much better</li>\n<li>The browser version of Moo.do now supports printing, putting each pane in a board on its own page.</li>\n<li>It’s now much easier to link to local files in the desktop app. When you drag a file onto Moo.do it will let you choose between linking a local file or uploading to Drive.</li>\n<li>The heading of a zoomed item is now editable</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"isSinglePost":true}}
