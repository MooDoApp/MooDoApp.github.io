With that done, we are happy to announce that items in the Agenda pane are now editable!</p>\n<p>To make editing in the Agenda pane feel good, items need to move gracefully as their dates and priorities change instead of jumping around or disappearing completely if a date is invalid. We achieve this by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delaying moving an Agenda item until a different item is selected</li>\n<li>Animating the item into its new position to make it clear what is changing.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"postImg postImgAgenda\" src=\"/blog/img/update-editable-agenda1.gif\" />\n\n<p>Another benefit of being able to animate items as their positions change is that it makes it clearer what is happening during search. Also it looks really cool :).</p>\n<img class=\"postImg postImgAgenda\" src=\"/blog/img/update-editable-agenda2.gif\" />\n\n<p>This is important for the Google Calendar plugin to work well because it will allow you to change your Google Calendar event names or dates/times right in the Agenda. We’re doing final testing of the Google Calendar plugin now, so you’ll see it soon!</p>\n<h1 id=\"in-development\">In Development</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Calendar sync</li>\n<li>Improved Search UI</li>\n<li>Gmail integration</li>\n</ul>\n<style>\n.postImgAgenda {\n    width: 400px;\n    margin: 40px auto;\n}\n</style>\n"}],"isSinglePost":true}}
