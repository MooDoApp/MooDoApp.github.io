The boards inside that folder and all the documents contained within them will be copied into a template and you’ll be given a URL that you can share to use that template.</p>\n<p>If you’d like, you can embed these templates in blog posts describing your workflow, or you can simply share the template itself. In the future we’ll add a way to install templates into your account as well as view/install counting to create a dashboard of the most popular templates. For now, please let us know what else you’d like to see out of this Templates feature.</p>\n<p>Note: Templates are a copy of all of the documents in those boards that does not stay in sync. You can update the template by saving it again.</p>\n<h1 id=\"multiselect-drag-drop\">Multiselect drag/drop</h1>\n<p>This has been requested for a long time, and we’re very excited to have finally released it! You can now highlight multiple items and drag/drop of all of them at once.</p>\n<h1 id=\"custom-hotkeys\">Custom Hotkeys</h1>\n<p>This has also been requested for a long time! There is a new page in the Settings to customize your hotkeys, where you can modify existing hotkeys or add new ones.</p>\n<h1 id=\"demo-of-features\">Demo of Features</h1>\n<p>Using the new templates system, we’ve set up a live demo at <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/demo/\">https://www.moo.do/demo/</a>. We will continue adding more helpful details and augmenting it with more boards showing how Moo.do works. If you have any suggestions for adding to it, please <a href=\"mailto:contact@moo.do\">let us know</a> or join our <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/beta\">beta community</a>.</p>\n"}],"isSinglePost":true}}
