There’s a new option in the settings which is enabled by default:
<img class="postImg" src="/blog/img/update-images-2.png" /></p>
<p>With that setting enabled, you can add images in multiple ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the + button next to an empty item and select Image</li>
<li>Click the image icon at the top of a pane</li>
<li>Drag an image file from your computer onto a pane</li>
<li>Paste a link to an image</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="postImg" src="/blog/img/update-images-3.png" /></p>
<p>You can resize the images to fit your document perfectly, and you can always toggle between showing the image or its text representation by right clicking it and selecting “Show as text”.</p>
<p>Are there any additional features you’d like to see for images?</p>

Until now we had been focused on putting the pieces together: outlining, task management, calendar, and email. And with that complete, we took a step back to redesign Moo.do around the way people actually use it.</p>
<p>We worked with a group of wonderful beta testers, experimenting and tweaking both our and their ideas until they felt right, resulting in what we think is a much better product.</p>
<p>And today we are very happy to finally release this update in public beta to everyone!</p>
<h1 id="get-into-it">Get into it</h1>
<p>The new web app is at a new address: <a href="https://www.moo.do/web/">https://www.moo.do/web/</a>. The Mac and Windows apps will update themselves, or download them and the new Linux app at <a href="https://www.moo.do/download/">https://www.moo.do/download/</a>. In the app you will see a “Use latest version” checkbox in the <span class="onlyMac">Moo.do</span><span class="onlyWin">system File</span> menu to toggle between the latest version and the previous version.<span class="onlyWin"> On Windows 8 and 10, you may need to press Alt to open the File menu.</span></p>
<p>Note: This update is for the desktop apps. An update for the mobile apps will be coming in a few weeks.</p>
<h1 id="new-design">New design</h1>
<p>We’ve updated the design of the app with a more modern look. The new top toolbar makes it easy to switch boards and takes up less of that crucial horizontal space, or the sidebar is still an option if you prefer it.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgFull" src="/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-2.gif" /></p>
<h1 id="view-your-tasks-from-any-angle">View your tasks from any angle</h1>
<p>We love the Outline for quickly laying out projects and tasks, but there’s often better ways to get an overview of your day or see tasks in different contexts. So Moo.do now has many ways to view and manage your data.
<!-- Screenshot of all the views in pane config --></p>
<h2 id="project-view">Project View</h2>
<p>The new Project View retains all the power of the Outline with collapsible nodes, but is laid out in a familiar task-management view grouped by project.
<img class="postImg postImgFull" style="width: 360px;" src="/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-3.png" /></p>
<h2 id="tag-contact-priority-views">Tag, Contact, Priority views</h2>
<p>For those people who like to organize with Tags (as context for GTD or to separate phases of a project), the Tag view makes it easy to view projects grouped by tag and drag items between tag blocks. It’s similarly easy to manage and reorganize tasks by contact or priority.
<img class="postImg postImgFull" src="/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-4.png" /></p>
<h2 id="agenda-view">Agenda view</h2>
<p>The Agenda has been completely redesigned. Each item now shows its context and is expandable to show all its children. The Agenda has new Today/Week/All views, and it’s customizable to change the order and show any Tags you’d like. And it just looks nicer.
<img class="postImg postImgFull" style="width: 360px;" src="/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-5.png" /></p>
<h2 id="calendar-view-is-now-free">Calendar view is now free</h2>
<p>We feel that the calendar is a core feature of Moo.do, so we’re making it a free feature. And it has a new 3 day (customizable) view.</p>
<h2 id="sorting">Sorting</h2>
<p>The new view modes can be sorted alphabetically, by number of items, priority, date due, and date created. And the Agenda can be sorted by date created and date completed, which is very useful to track the tasks you’ve completed over time.
<img class="postImg postImgFull" style="width: 460px;" src="/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-6.png" /></p>
<h2 id="search-upgraded">Search upgraded</h2>
<p>Search now supports OR to show results from multiple searches. New date-based searches like <span class="date">before:@tomorrow</span> and <span class="date">@overdue</span> help keep on top of what to do next. And you can type $ to quickly autocomplete an item to zoom into.
<img class="postImg postImgFull" style="width: 460px;" src="/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-7.png" /></p>
<h1 id="design-your-document">Design your document</h1>
<p>You can now format text and include inline images. New Display Settings give more control over how your document looks. Notes and emails support rich text. And panes are resizable to fully customize what you’re focused on.
<img class="postImg postImgFull" style="width: 460px;" src="/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-8.png" /></p>
<h1 id="more-powerful-boards">More powerful Boards</h1>
<p>Boards can be quickly switched by hotkey <span class="hotkey"><span class="hotkeyPri"></span> + Shift + 1,2,3,…</span>, dragged to rearrange, and have a new option to Clone. Each pane has an option to “Open in new board.” And an extra fun feature: you can drag an item onto a board to switch to it and drop the item into that board.</p>
<h1 id="speed-and-fixes">Speed and fixes</h1>
<p>We made some large changes to the core infrastructure, so Moo.do is now smaller in size, loads faster, syncs faster, and collapses items faster. A lot of bugs have been fixed, most notably: calendar and email sync problems, notification bugs, and dates not rolling over to the next day correctly.</p>
<h1 id="significant-changes">Significant changes</h1>
<p>We kept this update in beta for so long because we were making some breaking changes that we wanted to stabilize before releasing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Soft dates (<span class="date">@now</span>, <span class="date">@next</span>, <span class="date">@soon</span>, <span class="date">@later</span>, <span class="date">@someday</span>) are being replaced by a more flexible system. Now that the Agenda supports adding any <span class="tag">#tag</span>, you have full control over what kind of soft dates you’d like to use, and how to order them. The old soft dates will appear on the agenda with their corresponding tag, like <span class="date">@soon</span> and <span class="tag">#soon</span> will go together.</li>
<li>The “Show Bullets” display mode is removed in favor of prefixes. If you were using “Show Bullets”, then items without prefixes will be converted to use the Bullet prefix.</li>
<li>Items now hide when completed, so you don’t need to archive items after completing. If you’d like to see completed items, there’s a search filter to “show completed items.”</li>
<li><span class="hotkey"><span class="hotkeyPri"></span> + Click</span> tags and dates to search for them, and <span class="hotkey"><span class="hotkeyAlt"></span> + Click</span> to remove them <!-- TODO alt/option key --></li>
<li>Many of the hotkeys have been changed and improved. Press <span class="hotkey"><span class="hotkeyPri"></span> + /</span> to see the Hotkey list.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="lots-of-new-settings">Lots of new settings</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Default item type:</b> Set the default prefix for new items. If you prefer the bulleted look of an Outliner, choose Bullet. If you prefer a checklist, choose Task. If you prefer the flat look of a document, choose None.</li>
<li><b>Show Markdown formatting:</b> The Markdown formatting characters are hidden by default now, but you can optionally show them if you like.</li>
<li><b>Agenda sorting:</b> Rearrange the order of the Agenda and add any custom tags onto the Agenda.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="beta">Beta</h1>
<p>Our beta program has been so successful that we’re going to keep it going and open it up to everyone, although there will be a much shorter time between releases in the future. If you would like to help us shape the product, check out <a href="https://www.moo.do/beta/">https://www.moo.do/beta/</a> to join our Slack community.</p>
<h1 id="what-s-next">What’s next</h1>
<p>Our next major project will be to put some serious work into the iOS and Android apps, fixing bugs and bringing it up to the quality level of the desktop app.</p>

<p>In this update we have a variety of updates mainly focused on improving the iOS and Android apps.</p>
<h1 id="general">General</h1>
<p>Zooming in the overview fades items out of view and displays the zoomed item with bold text. This makes it easier to jump between projects.</p>
<p><div class="postImg postImgVideo postImgNovDesign">
    <video loop muted playsinline autoplay poster="/img/help/basics/overview.png">
        <source src="/img/help/basics/overview.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
</div>
Standard Gmail labels have icons for easier navigation between labels. Open the overview or click the title in the top bar to switch.</p>
<h1 id="ios-and-android">iOS and Android</h1>
<p>The top bar now shows the currently zoomed item as well as the hierarchy above it. Search and filter are in a second bar that hides when you scroll down. View search again by scrolling back up.
The keyboard toolbar is larger and more attractive. It saves your scroll position so the buttons you last used are always visible.
<img class="postImg postImgNovDesign" src="/blog/img/update-november-mobile1.png"></img></p>
<p>The email preview has arrows at the top to navigate between emails, and a toolbar at the bottom for common actions.
<img class="postImg postImgNovDesign" src="/blog/img/update-november-mobile2.png"></img></p>
<p>The overview has a dark background and larger spacing for items, for easier navigation.
<img class="postImg postImgNovDesign" src="/blog/img/update-november-mobile3.png"></img></p>
<h1 id="desktop">Desktop</h1>
<p>The pane header is rearranged to put item titles on the bottom row, with the zoomed item in big bold text. All of the action buttons are together at the right side, and search is centered on the top row.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgNovDesign postImgNovWide" src="/blog/img/update-november-desktop.png"></img></p>
<p>Agenda blocks are collapsible, so you can hide the blocks you don’t care to see right now. This state is saved per-pane.</p>
<h1 id="help-us-improve">Help us improve</h1>
<p>As always, please let us know if you find any issues or how we can make our apps better for you. Thanks!</p>

<p>Once you have selected the date format you want to use, all previous dates will be automatically updated for you. All dates that you enter in the future will be assumed to be in the format you have selected. Each person collaborating on a document will see dates in the format that they have selected.</p>
<h1 id="onenote-integration">OneNote integration</h1>
<p>If you paste a OneNote link into Moo.do, you will now see a OneNote icon next to it. Clicking a OneNote link will open it in the native OneNote app.</p>

The old soft dates will appear on the agenda with their corresponding tag, like <span class="date">@soon</span> and <span class="tag">#soon</span> will go together.</li>\n<li>The \u201CShow Bullets\u201D display mode is removed in favor of prefixes. If you were using \u201CShow Bullets\u201D, then items without prefixes will be converted to use the Bullet prefix.</li>\n<li>Items now hide when completed, so you don\u2019t need to archive items after completing. If you\u2019d like to see completed items, there\u2019s a search filter to \u201Cshow completed items.\u201D</li>\n<li><span class="hotkey"><span class="hotkeyPri"></span> + Click</span> tags and dates to search for them, and <span class="hotkey"><span class="hotkeyAlt"></span> + Click</span> to remove them \x3C!-- TODO alt/option key --></li>\n<li>Many of the hotkeys have been changed and improved.
