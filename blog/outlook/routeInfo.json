Then they will be available in the Email pane as well as for composing new emails.</p>\n<p>Like the new Gmail integration, this is only available in the <a href=\"/download/\">desktop app</a>, but the web version will show emails saved to documents and open outlook.com on click. The mobile apps can now open saved Outlook emails in-app.</p>\n<h1 id=\"chrome-extension-and-gmail-add-on\">Chrome Extension and Gmail Add-On</h1>\n<p>The Moo.do Chrome Extension now supports saving multiple emails at once in Gmail and both it and the Gmail Add-On have reduced the amount of email content they need to save.</p>\n<h1 id=\"get-started\">Get started</h1>\n<p>The desktop apps should update themselves, but if they don’t or you want to download it, you can get it at <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/download/\">https://www.moo.do/download</a>.
