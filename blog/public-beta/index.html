Moo.do lets you organize your life as easily as writing on a piece of paper. Moo.do organizes your projects, to do lists, calendar, contacts, reminders, events, and anything else you can write down. It is flexible, available offline, works on your mobile devices, and synchronizes in realtime with all your devices and other collaborators. You can even share specific lists with your friends, group members or co-workers.

Two years ago we found ourselves and our friends frustrated with the difficulty of organizing and prioritizing multiple personal and work projects. We started working towards creating a tool that could be both powerful and easy to use.

As of today Moo.do is accessible to anyone by opening http://moo.do on in a browser on your computer, iPhone, iPad, or Android device. In the near future native applications will be available for each platform, but you don’t have to wait for them as the mobile web app is fully featured.

We hope that Moo.do will help you organize your life and keep you on track. If you have feedback, questions, or would like to request a feature - get in touch, we would love to help you out.
