There are small tweaks all over the app but the most notable changes are:</p>\n<p><p></p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Top buttons moved into a sidebar.</strong> This makes it clearer what the buttons do and we think itâ€™s prettier :). Toggle the sidebar with <strong>Cmd + Option + S</strong> on Mac and <strong>Ctrl + Shift + I</strong> on Windows or Linux, and you can still access the buttons by hotkey.</li>\n<li><strong>Rearranged pane header.</strong> The titles are on the first row and search is on the second row, with the search box and filters split to make them more distinct.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved workspace switching.</strong> Open the boards menu with <strong><span class=\"hotkeySec\">Ctrl</span> + B</strong> and use the arrow keys to switch between them.</li>\n<li><strong>Many icon changes.</strong> We switched many old icons for newer, prettier icons from the Material Design icon set.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"postImg postImgUpdateDesign\" src=\"/blog/img/update-design.png\" /></p>\n<h1 id=\"help-us-improve\">Help us improve</h1>\n<p>As always, please let us know if you find any issues or how we can make our apps better for you.
