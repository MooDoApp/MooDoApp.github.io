We really appreciate your feedback and support that has helped us shape Moo.do into a great tool for managing projects, tasks, and to-do lists. Now it’s time to make Moo.do into much more than just a to-do list app.

Moo.do was started with the goal of organizing everything in one place. The first step of that was to be great at organizing one thing, so Moo.do has thus far been an app for organizing lists of text. We&#39;ve spent the past few months building a plugin system that enables integration of all of the services you depend on into one organization system.

Google Drive Integration

Today we&#39;re launching Moo.do&#39;s first plugin: Google Drive. You can view the entire contents of your Drive within Moo.do in the new Drive Pane, drag files or folders onto your lists, search and focus the Drive Panes on individual folders, and drag files from your computer right into your Moo.do lists. Drive files work just like any other text in Moo.do: you can prioritize, schedule, tag, complete, and star them.

Try this live demo to see how the new Drive Pane works:


    


Premium

Together with the Drive plugin, we&#39;re launching our Premium plan. All of the features currently available in Moo.do will remain free, but premium users will have access to the new Drive plugin as well as many more Premium features in the future. To celebrate the Premium launch, we have special Early Adopter pricing of $4.95 / month, a 30% discount from the regular price. If you sign up now, you get Early Adopter pricing for life! You can sign up for Premium and get discounts for inviting your friends from the settings menu in the desktop version of Moo.do.

Discounts for inviting friends

You get 20% off of your Premium plan for every friend you invite that signs up. You can stack that discount as many times as you want, so if 20 of your friends sign up for Moo.do, you&#39;ll get 4 months for free! The friends you invite also get their first month of Moo.do Premium for free, so everyone wins :).

Help us grow

We really appreciate your support in becoming a Premium user and inviting your friends, which helps us get our new features and integrations into your hands as quickly as possible. Thank you!
