You will soon be able to <strong>organize your email</strong> in Moo.do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"email\">Email</h2>\n<p>We are making Moo.do a full email application for Gmail and also integrating it into other email apps, starting with <a href=\"http://www.getmailbird.com\">Mailbird</a>, a fantastic email app for Windows.</p>\n<p>Emails work just like everything else in Moo.do: you can prioritize, schedule, tag, complete, and star your emails. Scheduled and prioritized emails show up in your agenda so you know what emails to deal with next. You can organize emails into your projects and put them right on your to-do lists. Search filters emails the same way as tasks, so it fits right into your workflow.</p>\n<div class=\"twoPane demobg\">\n    <div id=\"demoInboxZero\" class=\"noInteractive\"></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"google-drive\">Google Drive</h2>\n<p>In addition to email, you can organize your Google Drive files and documents in your lists. If you drag a file from your computer into a Moo.do list, it will upload to Drive for you. Or if it’s already in Drive, Moo.do will find it and link to it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mailbird\">Mailbird</h2>\n<p>Moo.do is built into <a href=\"http://www.getmailbird.com\">Mailbird 2.0</a> as a dedicated sidebar, so you can drag your emails from Mailbird right into your Moo.do lists. See more about Mailbird at <a href=\"http://getmailbird.com\">http://getmailbird.com</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"try-it-now\">Try it now</h2>\n<p>We’ve updated our <a href=\"http://www.moo.do/\">landing page</a> with live demos of how email and file organization work, so please try it out and let us know what you think!</p>\n\n\n<style>\n#post_announceEmail .demo {\n    display: block;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n}\n#post_announceEmail .demobg {\n    position: relative;\n    margin: 30px auto;\n    max-width: 100%;\n}\nhtml:not(.mobile) #post_announceEmail .demobg {\n    height: 560px;\n}\n\n#post_announceEmail .demobg:not(.demoimg) {\n    width: 100%;\n}\n#post_announceEmail .demoimg {\n    width: 100%;\n    display: block;\n}\n</style>","script":"window.__addDemo(\n{\n    id: 'demoInboxZero',\n    src: '/web/#demo=true&touch=false&data=intro.inbox.0&script=inboxZero&panes=PaneGmail:1&dmode=0xb9',\n    img: '/img/ss/pressInboxZero.png'\n}\n);\nfunction onMessageInboxZero(e)\n{\n    if(e.data === 'done')\n    {\n        document.getElementById('demoInboxZero').classList.remove('noInteractive');\n    }\n}\n\nwindow.addEventListener('message', onMessageInboxZero, false);"}],"isSinglePost":true}}
