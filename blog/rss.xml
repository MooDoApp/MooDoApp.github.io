      <description><![CDATA[We&#39;ve added support for repeated dates!

You can add a repeating date to an item by starting the date entry with @every. We&#39;re quite excited to add this feature as it makes our Agenda significantly more powerful. We hope you find this useful - let us know if you have any suggestions or if we&#39;re missing any types of dates you need.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#39;ve added support for repeated dates!</p>

<p>You can add a repeating date to an item by starting the date entry with <b class="date">@every</b>. We&#39;re quite excited to add this feature as it makes our Agenda significantly more powerful. We hope you find this useful - let us know if you have any suggestions or if we&#39;re missing any types of dates you need.</p>

<h2>Using Repeated Dates</h2>

<p>Define a basic repeating date using a day of the week or a measure of time.</p>

<ul>
<li><b class="date">@every friday</b></li>
<li><b class="date">@every day 3:00pm</b></li>
<li><b class="date">@every 3 days</b></li>
</ul>

<p>By default the start of the repeat date is the current time. Use <b class="tag">from</b> to set a different start date.</p>

<ul>
<li><b class="date">@every friday from last wednesday</b></li>
<li><b class="date">@every tuesday from 11/22</b></li>
</ul>

<p>By default there is no end date specified. Use <b class="tag">until</b> to set an end date.</p>

<ul>
<li><b class="date">@every friday until december</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Create more complex repeating dates that refer to a specific day of the month.</p>

<ul>
<li><b class="date">@every 14th</b></li>
<li><b class="date">@every last day</b></li>
<li><b class="date">@every dec 10th</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Specify dates that skip weeks or only refer to specific weeks in a month. </p>

<ul>
<li><b class="date">@every other friday</b></li>
<li><b class="date">@every 3rd friday</b></li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<br>
Each time you complete the item with the repeated date it will create a new item with the date of the completed instance.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="complete">Stay organized <b>@11/19</b></span></li>
<li>Stay organized <b class="date">@every day from 11/20</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Date Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dates like <b class="date">@next friday 3pm</b> are parsed correctly.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are proud to officially announce the launch of <strong>Moo.do</strong> at <a href="http://www.moo.do/">http://moo.do</a> and on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moo.do-organize-your-way/id889830074?ls=1&amp;mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moo.do">Android</a>, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moodo/iffimmolghilclfndeiebgppddmagofk">Chrome</a> App Stores. <strong>Moo.do</strong> is designed to be the best and easiest way to organize everything in your life: projects, to-do lists, appointments, contacts, reminders, events, and anything else you can write down. As all modern apps should be, <strong>Moo.do</strong> is available on any computer, tablet, or phone and synchronizes all devices and users in realtime.</p>

<p>Throughout the development process we have been using <strong>Moo.do</strong> as our only tool for <a href="/blog/public-beta">planning, bug tracking, scheduling, and release tracking</a>. At the same time we have been using it to manage other projects, travel plans, and our day-to-day lives. Many of our beta testers have switched to using <strong>Moo.do</strong> as their primary organization system. Today we are happy to bring the power and simplicity of <strong>Moo.do</strong> to everyone.</p>

<p>As of today <strong>Moo.do</strong> is accessible on the iOS, Android, and Chrome App Stores and as a full-featured web app at <a href="http://www.moo.do/">http://moo.do</a>. Apps for Windows Phone, Windows 8, and Mac OS X will follow shortly.</p>

<p>We hope that <strong>Moo.do</strong> will help you organize your life and keep you on track. If you have feedback, questions, or would like to request a feature - get in touch, we would love to help you out.</p>

      <title>Moo.do for Scrum</title>
      <link>http://www.moo.do/blog/scrum</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Many friends of Moo.do like to organize their projects on a Scrum (or Kanban) board for Agile Development. This continues our series of examples of how people and teams are using Moo.do with a description of how Moo.do can be used as a Scrum board. While we appreciate the physicality of plastering notes on a wall, we think powerful software is much more effective and less messy.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many friends of <strong>Moo.do</strong> like to organize their projects on a Scrum (or Kanban) board for Agile Development. This continues our series of <a href="/blog/ideas">examples of how people and teams are using <strong>Moo.do</strong></a> with a description of how <strong>Moo.do</strong> can be used as a Scrum board. While we appreciate the physicality of plastering notes on a wall, we think powerful software is much more effective and less messy.</p>

<p><img alt="Post-it Madness" src="/blog/img/postits.jpg" id="postit-img" class="postImg"></img></p>

<h1>Organization</h1>

<p>First let&#39;s set up the sections of the board in outline form. We use <b>Todo</b>, <b>In Progress</b>, <b>Testing</b>, and <b>Complete</b> to describe the phases of each task. You could also subdivide your sections, like <b>Bugs</b> and <b>Features</b> for a software project.</p>

<div class="onePane demobg">
    <div id="demoOrganization"></div>
</div>

<p>This outline format is a great way to read through everything, but it gets hard to read when there&#39;s a lot of items in each list. So let&#39;s spread them out by adding more panes, with one focused on each list.</p>

<div class="unpadded">
    <div class="threePanes demobg">
        <div id="demoThreePanes"></div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption noMobile">This is a fully interactive instance of <b>Moo.do</b>. Try dragging items between panes by grabbing the space to the left of an item.</div>

<p>It&#39;s easy to visualize how much work is left in each phase and drag and drop items between panes as we make progress. Now that the basics are set up, let&#39;s look at what else <strong>Moo.do</strong> can do!</p>

<h1>Assign tasks</h1>

<p>Our team assigns tasks using a <b class="tag">#tag</b> for each person. I use <strong>Moo.do</strong>&#39;s search to view only my tasks or see what others on my team are working on.</p>

<div class="twoPane demobg">
    <div id="demoAssign"></div>
</div>

<h1>See what&#39;s important</h1>

<p>&quot;What Do I Do Next Paralysis&quot; can be a big problem when faced with a lot of tasks. Being able to quickly prioritize using <strong>Moo.do</strong>&#39;s starring and three priority levels makes it easy to always know what&#39;s next and what needs further discussion. During our meetings, we open an Agenda pane and talk through starred items and check up on high priority tasks. We can even focus and search the Agenda.</p>

<div class="twoPane demobg">
    <div id="demoAgenda"></div>
</div>

<h1>My to-do list</h1>

<p>I use <strong>Moo.do</strong>&#39;s&#39; powerful search to focus on just what I need.</p>

<table class="searchList">
<tr><td><b class="p0">!!!</b> -//</td><td>Important and incomplete items</td></tr>
<tr><td><b class="tag">#Grant</b> //</td><td>What Grant has finished</td></tr>
<tr><td><b class="tag">#iPhone</b></td><td>What needs to be fixed for iPhone</td></tr>
<tr><td><b class="tag">#Feedback</b> -#</td><td>Unassigned feedback</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It&#39;s great to have an overview of what everyone is doing, but it&#39;s very distracting (and scary!) to stare at it all day long. I check the overall list in the morning or evening and spend the day focused on my own tasks by searching for only tasks assigned to me, or even only my highest priority tasks.</p>

<div class="twoPane demobg">
    <div id="demoPersonal"></div>
</div>

<h1>Show a dashboard on a TV</h1>

<p>Many people like to have a scrum board on a wall in a central location that everyone can see. <strong>Moo.do</strong> is synchronized in real time as you type, so with <strong>Moo.do</strong> on a TV in the office, you&#39;ll see tasks getting moved around and completed as people work on them. You could have one pane showing what&#39;s happening in the &quot;In Progress&quot; section, one showing an agenda of the highest priority tasks, and one tracking finished tasks in the &quot;Complete&quot; section.</p>

We&#39;d love to hear about what you do now or how you stay organized with <strong>Moo.do</strong>. Check back soon for more case studies.</p>

      <title>Moo.do for Project Management</title>
      <link>http://www.moo.do/blog/project-management</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Moo.do is designed to be extremely flexible. Our goal is to allow anyone to organize in a way that makes the most sense for them. While building Moo.do, we&#39;ve been using it to manage its own development: as a planner, project manager, todo list, calendar, and bug tracker. I&#39;ll describe how we use Moo.do as the first of a series of examples of how people and teams are using Moo.do.

We have spent a majority of the development process working remotely and in vastly different time zones, so making sure we know what to work on next without additional communication is especially important.

We found traditional systems for project management and bug tracking to be too heavy. We wasted our time fighting software and waiting for pages to load, so we designed Moo.do to be a powerful tool for managing a project and tracking its bugs while taking a content first approach with a minimalist UI. At Moo.do, we use our own product to organize everything about itself: features, bugs, ideas, marketing, and feedback. Today I&#39;ll focus on how we manage feature planning, bugs, and managing product ideas.

At <strong>Moo.do</strong>, we use our own product to organize everything about itself: features, bugs, ideas, marketing, and feedback. Today I&#39;ll focus on how we manage feature planning, bugs, and managing product ideas.</p>

<h1>Organization</h1>

<p>At the beginning of a milestone, we discuss the main goals we want to accomplish and lay out a basic plan separated into distinct groups.</p>

<div class="onePane demobg" id="wrapOrg">
    <div id="demoOrganization"></div>
</div>

<p>As we progress through the milestone, we mark tasks complete and add new bugs under Major and Minor Bugs. At the end of a milestone, we drag and drop tasks that did not get completed into the next release, and discuss what features and bugs from Future we want to bring in. Then we mark the current release complete and move onto the next one.</p>

<h1>Prioritizing and Starring</h1>

<p>We use the three priority levels in <strong>Moo.do</strong> to describe how soon we should deal with tasks. For us, <span class="p0">high priority</span> means that it should be handled immediately, while <span class="p1">lower priorities</span> are more important than most things, but can wait. We use <span class="pStar">starring to highlight things</span> for the other person to look at.</p>

<p>When I look over what to do for the day, I mark what tasks I&#39;m planning to do today as <span class="p0">high priority</span> to make them easy to find. Grant prefers to prioritize based on severity, marking the scariest bugs as <span class="p0">high priority</span> so he&#39;ll keep thinking about them.</p>

<h1>Tagging</h1>

<p>We use tags to assign tasks, group related tasks together, or mark for future action.</p>

<table class="tagsList">
<tr><td>#Grant</td><td>Assigned to Grant</td></tr>
<tr><td>#J</td><td>Assigned to Jay</td></tr>
<tr><td>#Discuss</td><td>To discuss in our next phone call</td></tr>
<tr><td>#punt</td><td>Delay until the next milestone</td></tr>
<tr><td>#watch</td><td>Bug that's hard to reproduce - keep an eye on it</td></tr>
</table>

<h1>Searching</h1>

<p>This is where Moo.do is incredibly powerful. Between all the features, bugs, ideas, marketing plans, and user feedback, we have thousands of lines of data. Search lets us focus on what&#39;s important right now.</p>

<ul>
<li>We can start a search with <span class="search">-</span> to hide irrelevant items, and we can combine that with <span class="search">//</span>, the search shorthand for &#39;complete,&#39; to hide completed items.</li>
<li>We search for <span class="search">-// -<span class="tag">#punt</span></span> to hide all completed and postponed tasks.</li>
<li>If I want to see everything assigned to me, I search for <span class="search"><span class="tag">#J</span></span></li>
<li>To see my todo list for the day, I search for <span class="search"><span class="tag">#J</span> <span class="p0 b">!!</span></span> to show only tasks assigned to me of at least medium priority.</li>
<li>When we get on the phone we both search for <span class="search"><span class="tag">#Discuss</span></span> and go down the list together.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Multiple Panes</h1>

<p>It is often quite useful to look at the same data in different ways. A nice way to use search in <strong>Moo.do</strong> is to have multiple panes open with different searches. Hiding completed and punted tasks shows what&#39;s left.</p>

<div class="twoPane demobg" id="wrapPanes1">
    <div id="demoPanes1"></div>
</div>

<div class="caption noMobile">This is a fully interactive instance of <b>Moo.do</b>. Try your own searches like <span class="search">-//</span> or <span class="search"><span class="p0 b">!!!</span></span>.</div>

<h1>Focus On You</h1>

<p>I like to use <strong>Moo.do</strong> full-screen with three panes open at once:</p>

<ul>
<li>Searched for <span class="search">-// -<span class="tag">#punt</span></span> as shown above. This is where I add, edit, and assign features or bugs. I can add to the current release or scroll down and add them to the next one.</li>
<li>Focused on this release and searched for <span class="search">-// -<span class="tag">#punt #J</span></span> to see my tasks.</li>
<li>Focused on this release and searched for <span class="search">-// -<span class="tag">#punt #J</span> <span class="p0 b">!!</span></span> which is my todo list for the day.</li>
</ul>

<div class="twoPane demobg" id="wrapPanes2">
    <div id="demoPanes2"></div>
</div>

<div class="caption noMobile">This is a fully interactive instance of <b>Moo.do</b>. Try your own searches like <span class="search"><span class="tag">#Grant</span></span> to see Grant's tasks.</div>

<h1>Progress Tracking</h1>

<p><strong>Moo.do</strong> keeps track of when items are completed, which has a variety of uses for project management.</p>

<ul>
<li>When I start work for the day, I can see what Grant finished the day before.</li>
<li>When I finish a day&#39;s work, I like to look over what I got done.</li>
<li>We can look through the past couple of weeks and get a feel for how quickly we&#39;re moving.</li>
</ul>

<div class="onePane demobg" id="wrapAgenda">
    <div id="demoAgenda" class="demo"></div>
</div>

<h1>Discussion</h1>

<p>In some cases we want to add more information to a task, or I want to ask a question on a task Grant added. To add details to a bug or feature, ask questions, add steps to reproduce a bug, or request a code review, we add a sub-item assigned to the other person with a tag, and star it to make it stand out. We often have short conversations as we try to reproduce a bug.</p>

<div class="onePane demobg" id="wrapDiscussion">
    <div id="demoDiscussion" class="demo"></div>
</div>

      <title>Public Beta</title>
      <link>http://www.moo.do/blog/public-beta</link>
      <description><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Moo.do is entering into public beta today at http://moo.do. Moo.do lets you organize your life as easily as writing on a piece of paper. Moo.do organizes your projects, to do lists, calendar, contacts, reminders, events, and anything else you can write down. It is flexible, available offline, works on your mobile devices, and synchronizes in realtime with all your devices and other collaborators. You can even share specific lists with your friends, group members or co-workers.

Two years ago we found ourselves and our friends frustrated with the difficulty of organizing and prioritizing multiple personal and work projects. We started working towards creating a tool that could be both powerful and easy to use.

As of today Moo.do is accessible to anyone by opening http://moo.do on in a browser on your computer, iPhone, iPad, or Android device. In the near future native applications will be available for each platform, but you don’t have to wait for them as the mobile web app is fully featured.

We hope that Moo.do will help you organize your life and keep you on track. If you have feedback, questions, or would like to request a feature - get in touch, we would love to help you out.
