            <title><![CDATA[Big update: killer task management]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We began this year with a new goal: to make Moo.do into a <strong>killer task management app</strong>. Until now we had been focused on putting the pieces together: outlining, task management, calendar, and email. And with that complete, we took a step back to redesign Moo.do around the way people actually use it.</p>
<p>We worked with a group of wonderful beta testers, experimenting and tweaking both our and their ideas until they felt right, resulting in what we think is a much better product.</p>
<p>And today we are very happy to finally release this update in public beta to everyone!</p>
<h1 id="get-into-it">Get into it</h1>
<p>The new web app is at a new address: <a href="https://www.moo.do/web/">https://www.moo.do/web/</a>. The Mac and Windows apps will update themselves, or download them and the new Linux app at <a href="https://www.moo.do/download/">https://www.moo.do/download/</a>. In the app you will see a “Use latest version” checkbox in the <span class="onlyMac">Moo.do</span><span class="onlyWin">File</span> menu to toggle between the latest version and the previous version.<span class="onlyWin"> You may need to press Alt to open the File menu.</span></p>
<p>Note: This update is for the desktop apps. An update for the mobile apps will be coming in a few weeks.</p>
<h1 id="new-design">New design</h1>
<p>We’ve updated the design of the app with a more modern look. The new top toolbar makes it easy to switch boards and takes up less of that crucial horizontal space, or the sidebar is still an option if you prefer it.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgFull" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-2.gif" /></p>
<h1 id="view-your-tasks-from-any-angle">View your tasks from any angle</h1>
<p>We love the Outline for quickly laying out projects and tasks, but there’s often better ways to get an overview of your day or see tasks in different contexts. So Moo.do now has many ways to view and manage your data.
<!-- Screenshot of all the views in pane config --></p>
<h2 id="project-view">Project View</h2>
<p>The new Project View retains all the power of the Outline with collapsible nodes, but is laid out in a familiar task-management view grouped by project.
<img class="postImg postImgFull" style="width: 360px;" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-3.png" /></p>
<h2 id="tag-contact-priority-views">Tag, Contact, Priority views</h2>
<p>For those people who like to organize with Tags (as context for GTD or to separate phases of a project), the Tag view makes it easy to view projects grouped by tag and drag items between tag blocks. It’s similarly easy to manage and reorganize tasks by contact or priority.
<img class="postImg postImgFull" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-4.png" /></p>
<h2 id="agenda-view">Agenda view</h2>
<p>The Agenda has been completely redesigned. Each item now shows its context and is expandable to show all its children. The Agenda has new Today/Week/All views, and it’s customizable to change the order and show any Tags you’d like. And it just looks nicer.
<img class="postImg postImgFull" style="width: 360px;" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-5.png" /></p>
<h2 id="calendar-view-is-now-free">Calendar view is now free</h2>
<p>We feel that the calendar is a core feature of Moo.do, so we’re making it a free feature. And it has a new 3 day (customizable) view.</p>
<h2 id="sorting">Sorting</h2>
<p>The new view modes can be sorted alphabetically, by number of items, priority, date due, and date created. And the Agenda can be sorted by date created and date completed, which is very useful to track the tasks you’ve completed over time.
<img class="postImg postImgFull" style="width: 460px;" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-6.png" /></p>
<h2 id="search-upgraded">Search upgraded</h2>
<p>Search now supports OR to show results from multiple searches. New date-based searches like <span class="date">before:@tomorrow</span> and <span class="date">@overdue</span> help keep on top of what to do next. And you can type $ to quickly autocomplete an item to zoom into.
<img class="postImg postImgFull" style="width: 460px;" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-7.png" /></p>
<h1 id="design-your-document">Design your document</h1>
<p>You can now format text and include inline images. New Display Settings give more control over how your document looks. Notes and emails support rich text. And panes are resizable to fully customize what you’re focused on.
<img class="postImg postImgFull" style="width: 460px;" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-desktop-2018-8.png" /></p>
<h1 id="more-powerful-boards">More powerful Boards</h1>
<p>Boards can be quickly switched by hotkey <span class="hotkey"><span class="hotkeyPri"></span> + Shift + 1,2,3,…</span>, dragged to rearrange, and have a new option to Clone. Each pane has an option to “Open in new board.” And an extra fun feature: you can drag an item onto a board to switch to it and drop the item into that board.</p>
<h1 id="speed-and-fixes">Speed and fixes</h1>
<p>We made some large changes to the core infrastructure, so Moo.do is now smaller in size, loads faster, syncs faster, and collapses items faster. A lot of bugs have been fixed, most notably: calendar and email sync problems, notification bugs, and dates not rolling over to the next day correctly.</p>
<h1 id="significant-changes">Significant changes</h1>
<p>We kept this update in beta for so long because we were making some breaking changes that we wanted to stabilize before releasing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Soft dates (<span class="date">@now</span>, <span class="date">@next</span>, <span class="date">@soon</span>, <span class="date">@later</span>, <span class="date">@someday</span>) are being replaced by a more flexible system. Now that the Agenda supports adding any <span class="tag">#tag</span>, you have full control over what kind of soft dates you’d like to use, and how to order them. The old soft dates will appear on the agenda with their corresponding tag, like <span class="date">@soon</span> and <span class="tag">#soon</span> will go together.</li>
<li>The “Show Bullets” display mode is removed in favor of prefixes. If you were using “Show Bullets”, then items without prefixes will be converted to use the Bullet prefix.</li>
<li>Items now hide when completed, so you don’t need to archive items after completing. If you’d like to see completed items, there’s a search filter to “show completed items.”</li>
<li><span class="hotkey"><span class="hotkeyPri"></span> + Click</span> tags and dates to search for them, and <span class="hotkey"><span class="hotkeyAlt"></span> + Click</span> to remove them <!-- TODO alt/option key --></li>
<li>Many of the hotkeys have been changed and improved. Press <span class="hotkey"><span class="hotkeyPri"></span> + /</span> to see the Hotkey list.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="lots-of-new-settings">Lots of new settings</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Default item type:</b> Set the default prefix for new items. If you prefer the bulleted look of an Outliner, choose Bullet. If you prefer a checklist, choose Task. If you prefer the flat look of a document, choose None.</li>
<li><b>Show Markdown formatting:</b> The Markdown formatting characters are hidden by default now, but you can optionally show them if you like.</li>
<li><b>Agenda sorting:</b> Rearrange the order of the Agenda and add any custom tags onto the Agenda.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="beta">Beta</h1>
<p>Our beta program has been so successful that we’re going to keep it going and open it up to everyone, although there will be a much shorter time between releases in the future. If you would like to help us shape the product, check out <a href="https://www.moo.do/beta/">https://www.moo.do/beta/</a> to join our Slack community.</p>
<h1 id="what-s-next">What’s next</h1>
<p>Our next major project will be to put some serious work into the iOS and Android apps, fixing bugs and bringing it up to the quality level of the desktop app.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This blog has been quiet recently not because nothing is happening, but the opposite! We’ve been quietly working on some big changes which we are now beta testing with a small group of users. We will have more to announce soon…</p>
<p>If you’re interested in helping with beta testing, and want to give lots of feedback to help shape a beta version that changes multiple times per day, go to <a href="https://www.moo.do/beta/">https://www.moo.do/beta/</a> for more info.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to sharing with we’ve been working on as soon as possible!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<style>
.postImgVideo video {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
.postImgNovDesign {

.postImgNovDesign.postImgNovWide {

}
</style>

<p>In this update we have a variety of updates mainly focused on improving the iOS and Android apps.</p>
<h1 id="general">General</h1>
<p>Zooming in the overview fades items out of view and displays the zoomed item with bold text. This makes it easier to jump between projects.</p>
<p><div class="postImg postImgVideo postImgNovDesign">
    <video loop muted playsinline autoplay poster="/img/help/basics/overview.png">
        <source src="https://www.moo.do/img/help/basics/overview.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
</div>
Standard Gmail labels have icons for easier navigation between labels. Open the overview or click the title in the top bar to switch.</p>
<h1 id="ios-and-android">iOS and Android</h1>
<p>The top bar now shows the currently zoomed item as well as the hierarchy above it. Search and filter are in a second bar that hides when you scroll down. View search again by scrolling back up.
The keyboard toolbar is larger and more attractive. It saves your scroll position so the buttons you last used are always visible.
<img class="postImg postImgNovDesign" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-november-mobile1.png"></img></p>
<p>The email preview has arrows at the top to navigate between emails, and a toolbar at the bottom for common actions.
<img class="postImg postImgNovDesign" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-november-mobile2.png"></img></p>
<p>The overview has a dark background and larger spacing for items, for easier navigation.
<img class="postImg postImgNovDesign" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-november-mobile3.png"></img></p>
<h1 id="desktop">Desktop</h1>
<p>The pane header is rearranged to put item titles on the bottom row, with the zoomed item in big bold text. All of the action buttons are together at the right side, and search is centered on the top row.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgNovDesign postImgNovWide" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-november-desktop.png"></img></p>
<p>Agenda blocks are collapsible, so you can hide the blocks you don’t care to see right now. This state is saved per-pane.</p>
<h1 id="help-us-improve">Help us improve</h1>
<p>As always, please let us know if you find any issues or how we can make our apps better for you. Thanks!</p>

<p>Once you have selected the date format you want to use, all previous dates will be automatically updated for you. All dates that you enter in the future will be assumed to be in the format you have selected. Each person collaborating on a document will see dates in the format that they have selected.</p>
<h1 id="onenote-integration">OneNote integration</h1>
<p>If you paste a OneNote link into Moo.do, you will now see a OneNote icon next to it. Clicking a OneNote link will open it in the native OneNote app.</p>

<ol>
<li>You have more control over what each item on your list is: headers, tasks, bullets, and numbered lists.</li>
<li>Along with the improved intro, it should be easier for new users to get started.</li>
<li>It’s pretty!</li>
</ol>

            <title><![CDATA[July Design Update]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This month we’ve been working with both new and power users to find pain points in our desktop UX. These updates include features for managing large documents, as well as making interactions more intuitive.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgJulyDesign" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-july-design.png" /></p>
<h1 id="panes-search-and-collapsing">Panes, search, and collapsing</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Collapse All</b> now collapses every item rather than just those at the top level.</li>
<li>Searching does not change the collapsed state of items. This means search will not expand everything to display matches.</li>
<li>A new feature called <b>Flat Search</b> has been added. This shows only items that are a direct match, without showing the full hierarchy. Begin using <b>Flat Search</b> by clicking the <img class="postImgJulyFlat" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-july-flat.png" /> icon or using the hotkey (<span class="hotkeySec"></span> + 6). Click the pencil icon to the left of a search result to see its full details.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="sidebar">Sidebar</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Documents</b> have been renamed to <b>Files</b> for clarity of their purpose.</li>
<li><b>Workspaces</b> have been renamed to <b>Boards</b> for clarity of their purpose.</li>
<li>The sidebar is updated to make the relationship between <b>Files</b> and <b>Boards</b> more clear.</li>
<li>The sidebar no longer fully hides, and instead shrinks to a very thin bar.</li>
<li>Toggle the sidebar width by clicking the small arrow at the top, or by dragging its edge.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="boards-previously-known-as-workspaces-">Boards (previously known as Workspaces)</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Boards</b> can be switched by clicking on them in the sidebar.</li>
<li>Use the <span class="hotkeySec"></span> + B hotkey to switch between <b>Boards</b> with arrow or number keys.</li>
<li>The <b>Boards</b> list in the sidebar can be sorted with drag/drop.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Design Update for Desktop and Web]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we have a new design for the desktop apps to make Moo.do more intuitive and more attractive. There are small tweaks all over the app but the most notable changes are:</p>
<p><p></p></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top buttons moved into a sidebar.</strong> This makes it clearer what the buttons do and we think it’s prettier :). Toggle the sidebar with <strong>Cmd + Option + S</strong> on Mac and <strong>Ctrl + Shift + I</strong> on Windows or Linux, and you can still access the buttons by hotkey.</li>
<li><strong>Rearranged pane header.</strong> The titles are on the first row and search is on the second row, with the search box and filters split to make them more distinct.</li>
<li><strong>Improved workspace switching.</strong> Open the boards menu with <strong><span class="hotkeySec">Ctrl</span> + B</strong> and use the arrow keys to switch between them.</li>
<li><strong>Many icon changes.</strong> We switched many old icons for newer, prettier icons from the Material Design icon set.</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Moo.do for Kanban]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Many <strong>Moo.do</strong> users like to organize their projects on a Kanban (or Scrum) board for Agile Development. This continues our series of <a href="https://www.moo.do/blog/ideas">examples of how people and teams are using <strong>Moo.do</strong></a> with a description of how <strong>Moo.do</strong> can be used as a Kanban board.</p>
<p><img alt="Post-it Madness" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/postits.jpg" id="postit-img" class="postImg"></img></p>
<p>##EXCERPT##</p>
<p class="noMobile">Note: These examples all live demos of <b>Moo.do</b> itself, so you can interact with them.</p>

<h1 id="organization">Organization</h1>
<p>First let’s set up the sections of the board in outline form. We use <b>Todo</b>, <b>In Progress</b>, <b>Testing</b>, and <b>Complete</b> to describe the phases of each task. You could also subdivide your sections, like <b>Bugs</b> and <b>Features</b> for a software project.</p>
<div class="onePane demobg">
    <div id="demoOrganization"></div>
</div>

<p>This outline format is a great way to read through everything, but it gets hard to read when there’s a lot of items in each list. So let’s spread them out by adding more panes, with one focused on each list.</p>
<div class="unpadded threePanesWrap">
    <div class="threePanes demobg">
        <div id="demoThreePanes"></div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>It’s easy to visualize how much work is left in each phase and drag and drop items between panes as we make progress. Now that the basics are set up, let’s look at what else <strong>Moo.do</strong> can do.</p>
<h1 id="assign-tasks">Assign tasks</h1>
<p>Our team assigns tasks using a <b class="tag">#tag</b> for each person. I use <strong>Moo.do</strong>‘s search to view only my tasks or see what others on my team are working on.</p>
<div class="twoPane demobg">
    <div id="demoAssign"></div>
</div>


<h1 id="see-what-s-important">See what’s important</h1>
<p>“What To Do Next Paralysis” can be a big problem when faced with a lot of tasks. Being able to quickly prioritize using <strong>Moo.do</strong>‘s starring and three priority levels makes it easy to always know what’s next and what needs further discussion. During our meetings, we open a Calendar pane and talk through starred items and check up on high priority tasks. We can even focus and search the Calendar.</p>
<div class="twoPane demobg">
    <div id="demoAgenda"></div>
</div>


<h1 id="my-to-do-list">My to-do list</h1>
<p>I use <strong>Moo.do</strong>‘s’ powerful search to focus on just what I need.</p>
<table class="searchList">
<tr><td><span class="search"><img src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/ideas-pri-med.png" width="46px" /><img src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/ideas-no-complete.png" width="28px" /></span></td><td>Important and incomplete items</td></tr>
<tr><td><b class="tag">#Grant</b><img src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/ideas-complete.png" width="28px" /></td><td>What Grant has finished</td></tr>
<tr><td><b class="tag">#iPhone</b></td><td>What needs to be fixed for iPhone</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="search">-<span class="tag">#J</span><img src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/ideas-pri-med.png" width="46px" /></span></td><td>My todo list for the day</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It’s great to have an overview of what everyone is doing, but it’s very distracting (and scary!) to stare at it all day long. I check the overall list in the morning or evening and spend the day focused on my own tasks by searching for only tasks assigned to me, or even only my highest priority tasks.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Moo.do for Project Management]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moo.do</strong> is designed to be extremely flexible. Our goal is to allow anyone to organize in a way that makes the most sense for them. While building <strong>Moo.do</strong>, we’ve been using it to manage its own development: as a planner, project manager, todo list, calendar, and bug tracker. I’ll describe how we use <strong>Moo.do</strong> as the first of a series of <a href="https://www.moo.do/blog/ideas">examples of how people and teams are using <strong>Moo.do</strong></a>.</p>
<p>We have spent a majority of the development process working remotely and in vastly different time zones, so making sure we know what to work on next without additional communication is especially important.</p>
<p>##EXCERPT##</p>
<p class="noMobile">Note: These examples all live demos of <b>Moo.do</b> itself, so you can interact with them.</p>


<h1 id="organization">Organization</h1>
<p>At the beginning of a milestone, we discuss the main goals we want to accomplish and lay out a basic plan separated into distinct groups.</p>
<div class="onePane demobg" id="wrapOrg">
    <div id="demoOrganization"></div>
</div>

<p>As we progress through the milestone, we mark tasks complete and add new bugs under Major and Minor Bugs. At the end of a milestone, we drag and drop tasks that did not get completed into the next release, and discuss what features and bugs from Future we want to bring in. Then we mark the current release complete and move onto the next one.</p>
<h1 id="prioritizing-and-starring">Prioritizing and Starring</h1>
<p>We use the three priority levels in <strong>Moo.do</strong> to describe how soon we should deal with tasks. For us, <span class="p0"><strong>high priority</strong></span> means that it should be handled immediately, while <span class="p1"><strong>lower priorities</strong></span> are more important than most things, but can wait. We use <span class="pStar"><strong>starring to highlight things</strong></span> for the other person to look at.</p>
<p>When I look over what to do for the day, I mark what tasks I’m planning to do today as <span class="p0"><strong>high priority</strong></span> to make them easy to find.</p>
<h1 id="tagging">Tagging</h1>
<p>We use tags to assign tasks, group related tasks together, or mark for future action.</p>
<table class="tagsList">
<tr><td>#G</td><td>Assigned to Grant</td></tr>
<tr><td>#J</td><td>Assigned to Jay</td></tr>
<tr><td>#test</td><td>Done, needs testing</td></tr>
<tr><td>#feedback</td><td>Needs feedback</td></tr>
<tr><td>#ready</td><td>Ready for merge</td></tr>
<tr><td>#b_foo</td><td>Task is completed in branch “foo”</td></tr>
<tr><td>#discuss</td><td>To discuss in our next phone call</td></tr>
<tr><td>#punt</td><td>Delay until the next milestone</td></tr>
<tr><td>#watch</td><td>Bug that’s hard to reproduce - keep an eye on it</td></tr>
</table>


<h1 id="searching">Searching</h1>
<p>This is where Moo.do is incredibly powerful. Between all the features, bugs, ideas, marketing plans, and user feedback, we have thousands of lines of data. Search lets us focus on what’s important right now.</p>
<p>As an example, I have a pane with the following search to show me what I am doing today:</p>
<center><img src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/ideas-proj-man-search.png" width="300px" /></center>

<table class="searchList tagsList">
<tr><td><span class="search"><span class="tag">#J</span></span></td><td>Shows only tasks assigned to me</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="search"><span class="tag">-#punt</span></span></td><td>Hides all postponed tasks</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/ideas-no-complete.png" width="28px" /></td><td>Hides completed tasks</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/ideas-pri-med.png" width="46px" /></td><td>Shows tasks of at least medium priority</td></tr>
</table>

<h1 id="multiple-panes">Multiple Panes</h1>
<p>It is often quite useful to look at the same data in different ways. A nice way to use search in <strong>Moo.do</strong> is to have multiple panes open with different searches. Hiding completed and punted tasks shows what’s left.</p>
<div class="twoPane demobg" id="wrapPanes1">
    <div id="demoPanes1"></div>
</div>
<div class="caption noMobile">This is a fully interactive instance of <b>Moo.do</b>. Try your own searches like <span class="tag">#Grant</span> or <span class="tag">#J</span>.</div>


<h1 id="focus-on-you">Focus On You</h1>
<p>I like to use <strong>Moo.do</strong> full-screen with three panes open at once:</p>
<ul class="searchList">
<li>Searched for <span class="search border">-<span class="tag">#punt</span><img src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/ideas-no-complete.png" width="28px" /></span> as shown above. This is where I add, edit, and assign features or bugs. I can add to the current release or scroll down and add them to the next one.</li>
<li>Focused on this release and searched for <span class="search border">-<span class="tag">#J -#punt</span><img src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/ideas-no-complete.png" width="28px" /></span> to see my tasks.</li>
<li>Focused on this release and searched for <span class="search border">-<span class="tag">#J -#punt</span><img src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/ideas-pri-med.png" width="46px" /></span> which is my todo list for the day.</li>
</ul>

<div class="twoPane demobg" id="wrapPanes2">
    <div id="demoPanes2"></div>
</div>
<div class="caption noMobile">This is a fully interactive instance of <b>Moo.do</b>. Try your own searches like <span class="search"><span class="tag">#Grant</span></span> to see Grant’s tasks.</div>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>In some cases we want to add more information to a task, or I want to ask a question on a task Grant added. To add details to a bug or feature, ask questions, add steps to reproduce a bug, or request a code review, we add a sub-item assigned to the other person with a tag, and star it to make it stand out. We often have short conversations as we try to reproduce a bug.</p>
<div class="onePane demobg" id="wrapDiscussion">
    <div id="demoDiscussion"></div>
</div>

            <title><![CDATA[Calendar Pane (Beta)]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Moo.do now has a full Calendar! The new Calendar Pane has the original Agenda view as well as Day, Week, and Month views.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgUpdateCalendarPane" src="https://www.moo.do/img/about/CalendarPane.gif" /></p>
<p>While we love the Agenda view for an overview of what’s next, it is much easier to schedule and manage tasks, appointments, and emails on a calendar.</p>
<h1 id="moo-do-tasks-google-calendar">Moo.do tasks + Google Calendar</h1>
<p>Combined with the Google Calendar integration, the Calendar Pane shows Moo.do tasks as well as appointments from Google Calendar. Moo.do and Google Calendar synchronize in both directions, so you can manage your calendar with Moo.do as well as work with your Moo.do events from other Calendar apps.</p>
<h1 id="calendar-item-context">Calendar item context</h1>
<p>Clicking an item in the calendar opens a new item details popup, which shows breadcrumbs for its parents, notes, and children.
<img class="postImg postImgUpdateCalendarPane2" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-calendar-pane.png" /></p>
<h1 id="zoom-and-search-calendar">Zoom and search Calendar</h1>
<p>Search in the Calendar is the same as in other panes, so you can zoom the Calendar into a project and search for tags or other details, or show only high priority events.</p>
<h1 id="premium">Premium</h1>
<p>Users of the free version of Moo.do will continue to have the Agenda, but the new Day, Week, and Month views are part of Moo.do Premium.</p>
<h1 id="help-us-improve">Help us improve</h1>
<p>This is an Early Access release, meaning we want your feedback to get this feature right. Please let us know how you use the Calendar pane and how we can improve it for you. Thank you!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past two months we’ve been steadily improving the mobile Gmail experience, and today we are releasing some new features that make organizing your emails much easier.</p>
<h1 id="drag-to-outline">Drag to Outline</h1>
<p>This makes it super quick to move emails into your Outline. When you drag an email onto “Drag to Outline,” Moo.do quickly switches to your Outline Pane to drop the email.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgMobileUpdate" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-mobile-gmail-drag.gif" /></p>
<h1 id="drop-bucket">Drop Bucket</h1>
<p>The other option you can see in the above image is “Drag here to save,” which makes it much easier to rearrange items in large documents. Dropping items on this area saves them, and then you can drag them out later.</p>
<h1 id="instant-pane-switching">Instant pane switching</h1>
<p>We’ve also been doing a lot of work on the speed of the iOS and Android apps, so you can now switch panes with no delay.</p>

<p>We are launching the mobile Gmail pane in beta today to bring it to you as quickly as possible. While mobile Gmail is in beta, we will be continuing to add email features and tighter integrations between your email and your Outline, as well as adding educational content on how to get the most of out Moo.do.</p>
<p>The Gmail pane will be available on your phone or tablet if you are a Premium user and have enabled the Gmail plugin in the desktop app.</p>

<p>We’ve received many requests for a better way to manage multiple panes and workflows, especially since the launch of the Gmail plugin. So today Moo.do has a new Premium feature: Workspaces.</p>
<p>Workspaces lets you save multiple sets of panes and easily switch between workflows. So if you use one set of panes for processing your email, another for managing your team, and another for focusing on your own work, you can save each Workspace and easily move between them.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our next major goal for Moo.do is to bring the mobile app up to date with all of the features we have added on the desktop. Today’s update is the first step towards that goal, bringing the iOS and Android apps up to date with modern design patterns and preparing to support the Gmail and Drive panes.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Moo.do will now use your signature and alias settings from Gmail. You don’t even have to do anything to set up signatures in Moo.do.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who requested that feature! We’re always looking for ways to improve Moo.do, so please let us know if there’s anything else that can make it better for you.</p>
<p>We’re also very excited that Moo.do is on Product Hunt today! Your support and thoughts in the comments would be incredibly helpful to us. Thank you!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Four months ago we released the Gmail plugin into Early Access Beta. Thanks to all of your support and feedback, we are happy to announce that Moo.do for Gmail is now available for free to everyone!</p>
<p>We originally started Moo.do because we wanted to manage our email, tasks, and calendar together in one powerful organization system. Now that we have a full email client built into Moo.do, we’ve finally realized our goal. This is a very exciting day for us!</p>
<p>Check out this longer article on Medium about why we integrated email into Moo.do and how it works: <a href="https://medium.com/moo-do/were-making-email-a-powerful-todo-list-a418d6ef0580">https://medium.com/moo-do/were-making-email-a-powerful-todo-list-a418d6ef0580</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gmail Priority View]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We want to make it easy to quickly process your emails and keep track of what needs further action or response, so we have a new Priority View to sort emails by priority. Click on the new <img class="postImgPriTime" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-priority-view2.png"></img> icon in the Gmail Pane to switch to the Priority View.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgPriority" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-priority-view.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Our favorite way to use the Priority View is to run through emails in two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Triage emails in the normal time view, marking important emails with a priority or star.</li>
<li>Switch to Priority View and start at the top, handling emails in priority order.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re excited to hear how you use the Priority View and how we can make it better for you.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>If you have multiple Gmail accounts for personal and work emails you can now link them together in Moo.do. In the ‘Linked Accounts’ page of the Settings just enter the email address of the account you want to link.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-accounts-2.png"><img class="postImg postImgAccounts2" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-accounts-2.png" /></a></p>
<p>Right now linked accounts only have access to Gmail. In the future we plan to expand this so you can access documents, and calendars across accounts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-accounts-1.png"><img class="postImg postImgAccounts1" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-accounts-1.png" /></a></p>
<p>This update also includes a lot of bug fixes, expecially for iOS and Android. If you see anything that looks broken or doesn’t work quite right, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@moo.do">support@moo.do</a>!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pricing/Trial Update]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>As the Gmail plugin comes out of Beta, we will be switching from Early Adopter pricing to the normal price of $7 / month and we will also begin offering a yearly pricing option of $70 / year. We want to give our current users time to trial our Premium features before going Premium which is available by going to the Settings menu in the desktop app.</p>
<p>The change in price will happen in two weeks on <strong>May 10th</strong>. As thanks for helping us grow in our early days, anyone that signs up for Premium before that date will continue to have Early Adopter pricing for life.</p>
<p>Before the Gmail plugin comes out of Beta we are trying to squash any remaining bugs. If you’ve noticed anything strange or are seeing any issues, please let us know and we will fix them for you. Thank you!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>As we are putting the final touches on the Gmail plugin we are releasing a much requested feature - Notes! With notes you can easily add more context and information to items without cluttering your outline. Notes display with a preview of their first line as small gray text under an item.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgNotes postImgNotesSmall" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-notes1.png" /></p>
<p>You can click on a note or press Shift + Enter to open the note editor where you can write notes as long as you would like.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgNotes postImgNotesSmall" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-notes2.png" />
<img class="postImg postImgNotes postImgNotesBig" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-notes3.png" /></p>
<p>Notes are currently plain text, but we would like to make a more powerful rich note editor in the future. If you have any feedback or suggestions about what you’d like to see from Notes, we’d love to hear from you!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We’ve redesigned the Outline to make it easier to navigate large documents and renamed it to “Overview.” The new Overview is a companion that opens next to a pane for a top level view of your lists. As you scroll your list it highlights and tracks your position in the document. Clicking any item in the Overview will scroll to it and dragging items onto the Overview moves them to the list they are dropped on.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-overview1.png" target="_blank"><img class="postImg postImgOutline" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-overview1.png" /></a></p>
<p>This is an important change for the Gmail plugin. The new Overview provides easy access to Gmail labels and allows you to quickly drag emails onto the Overview to label them and move them out of the Inbox.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgOutline" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-overview2.gif" /></p>

<p>We have gotten a lot of great feedback from our private beta testers which has helped shape Moo.do into what we think is a great tool for working with email. We’re super excited about this and are working to get the Gmail plugin ready for you as quickly as possible. Here’s a quick preview of how email looks inside Moo.do.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="archived-pane">Archived Pane</h1>
<p>Moo.do now has a way to view and restore archived items with the new Archived Pane. Any items you’ve ever archived since Moo.do first launched will be in the Archived Pane. It works just like other panes, with the search and outline to help you find the items you’re looking for.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgArchived" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-archived1.png" /></p>
<h1 id="search-autocomplete">Search Autocomplete</h1>
<p>Continuing with the <a href="https://www.moo.do/blog/search">search improvements</a>, search autocompletes tags, dates, and contacts as you type. Tags are sorted by frequency to make the most likely choices easier to reach.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgArchived" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-archived2.png" /></p>
<h1 id="hotkeys">Hotkeys</h1>
<p>We added new hotkeys to make Moo.do more consistent with other apps and updated the Help to include the multiple hotkeys for each action. Check the Hotkeys section of the Help in Moo.do to see the full list. These are the new hotkeys on Mac (use Alt on Windows):</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Display Settings: Bullets and Lines]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>One fascinating thing we’ve learned while building Moo.do is that everybody uses it differently. Everyone considers something different to be the “killer feature” and people have very different preferences in how items should be displayed. So today we are introducing display themes to make Moo.do customizable to your individual preferences.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgSettings1" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-display-settings1.png" /></p>
<h1 id="display-themes">Display Themes</h1>
<p>The “Outliner” theme is similar to other popular outliner apps.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgSettings2" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-display-settings2.png" /></p>
<p>The “Light” theme is more compact and minimal.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgSettings2" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-display-settings3.png" /></p>
<h1 id="bullets">Bullets</h1>
<p>Clicking on an item’s bullet focuses that item. And as a fun bonus, tabbing and focusing are nicely animated.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgSettings2" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-display-settings4.gif" /></p>
<h1 id="feedback-please-">Feedback please!</h1>
<p>We would like to change the default theme to what our users like the most. We put in analytics to show us which settings are most popular, but we’d love to hear your feedback directly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which theme do you like the most?</li>
<li>Do you like headers to be bolded automatically or not?</li>
<li>Would you prefer the bullets and vertical lines be lighter or darker?</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we are releasing the Google Calendar plugin into Early Access! Google Calendar is a Premium plugin and it is also available as a free trial to our Community Members (anyone who has invited 5 or more people).</p>
<p>We are very excited to enable access to Google Calendar from Moo.do as this seamlessly integrates Moo.do with every calendar app out there. Moo.do and Google Calendar synchronize in both directions, meaning you can manage your calendar with Moo.do as well as work with your Moo.do events from your favorite Calendar app.</p>
<p>This has been the most requested feature on our <a href="https://feedback.moo.do/forums/274238-general/suggestions/6889894-google-calender-sync">feature requests page</a> and through our in-app feedback. Thank you to everyone who is helping to keep us pointed in the right direction to make everybody happier and more productive.</p>
<p>Let’s get into how Moo.do’s Google Calendar plugin works:</p>
<h1 id="choose-your-calendars">Choose your calendars</h1>

<h1 id="calendar-events-in-the-agenda">Calendar events in the agenda</h1>
<p>Your Google Calendar events are in your Agenda, marked by a <img class="postIconCalendar" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-calendar1.png" /> icon. You can edit existing events and add new events in the Agenda or you can drag them onto your lists. Use the <img class="postIconCalendar" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-calendar1.png" /> button in the search box to show or hide Calendar events.
<img class="postImg postImgCalendar postImgCalendar3" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-calendar3.png" /></p>
<h1 id="sync-your-events">Sync your events</h1>
<p>Press <span class="hotkeySec">Ctrl + C</span> on an item with a <span class="date">@date</span> and the event gets added to your calendar, with a <img class="postIconCalendar" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-calendar1.png" /> icon to show you that it’s synced. We don’t want to fill your calendar by automatically adding every <span class="date">@date</span> item, but if you want to add many events to your calendar in bulk, you can highlight multiple items and press <span class="hotkeySec">Ctrl + C</span> to add them all at once.</p>
<h1 id="edit-events-anywhere-anytime">Edit events anywhere, anytime</h1>
<p>Moo.do syncs both ways, so you can edit events in Moo.do or in your calendar and they’ll stay in sync everywhere. You can also add or modify events while offline and they will sync when you go back online.</p>
<h1 id="durations">Durations</h1>
<p>We’ve added support for durations for Calendar events. You can add an event with a duration formatted in many different ways.

<p>This is an Early Access release, meaning we want your feedback to get this feature right. Please let us know how you use your calendar with Moo.do and how we can make this integration better. We put a a feedback form in the Early Access section of the settings. Thank you!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Search]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Search is one of Moo.do’s most powerful features so we’ve upgraded it to be more intuitive and to support advanced search functions for our upcoming plugins.</p>
<p>With the new search you can easily set a minimum priority and show or hide completed and starred items. You can toggle these filters with the same hotkeys that you use on your lists.</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgSearch" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-search1.gif" /></p>
<p>Searching for dates is more powerful and easier to use. Searching for a <span class="date">@date</span> will match all items that fall on that date rather than just matching the text. For example, a search for <span class="date">@tomorrow</span> will show items on <span class="date">@10/27</span> or <span class="date">@tuesday</span>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Editable Agenda]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We wanted the Agenda to be editable from the beginning, but it hasn’t been possible to make it a good experience until the changes we made in our <a href="https://www.moo.do/blog/performance">performance update</a>. With that done, we are happy to announce that items in the Agenda pane are now editable!</p>
<p>To make editing in the Agenda pane feel good, items need to move gracefully as their dates and priorities change instead of jumping around or disappearing completely if a date is invalid. We achieve this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delaying moving an Agenda item until a different item is selected</li>
<li>Animating the item into its new position to make it clear what is changing.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="postImg postImgAgenda" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-editable-agenda1.gif" /></p>
<p>Another benefit of being able to animate items as their positions change is that it makes it clearer what is happening during search. Also it looks really cool :).</p>
<p><img class="postImg postImgAgenda" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-editable-agenda2.gif" /></p>
<p>This is important for the Google Calendar plugin to work well because it will allow you to change your Google Calendar event names or dates/times right in the Agenda. We’re doing final testing of the Google Calendar plugin now, so you’ll see it soon!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The most important feature of a productivity app is that it <strong>never</strong> lose your data, which is why we designed Moo.do so that losing data is not even possible. Moo.do keeps a full revision history of all changes so that if anything goes wrong, everything can always be recovered. We just released a new tool for browsing your revision history to get back anything you may have lost. If you ever need to get something back, you can either revert to a previous version or copy and paste what you need back into Moo.do.</p>
<p>You can find Revision History in the options menu below Export Data. If you have any trouble with this tool, please let us know. Nobody has ever lost data in Moo.do and we plan to keep it that way.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Performance Upgrade]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We just launched a <strong>huge</strong> performance upgrade for Moo.do which dramatically reduces load time and makes interaction feel much snappier. This update improves Moo.do everywhere: on the web, Chrome, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p>We’re serious when we say this is a <strong>huge</strong> upgrade. Check it out:</p>
<p>
    <img class="postImg postImgPerf" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-performance1.png" />
    <img class="postImg postImgPerf" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-performance2.png" />
    <img class="postImg postImgPerf" src="https://www.moo.do/blog/img/update-performance3.png" />
</p>

<p>This update was an unexpected delay in our roadmap. As we got into the development of the Gmail plugin and began loading our inboxes into Moo.do, we realized we could not provide a good email experience until we fixed the performance problems. Moo.do was fast with a few hundred items, but as documents grew over time, Moo.do was unable to keep up. It was especially noticeable with the mobile apps, which were basically unusable with large documents. Adding large email inboxes into the mix made it clear that we had to focus on performance before we could continue.</p>
<p>Now, Moo.do is snappy even with tens of thousands of items. And now that this big change is done, we’re back to building the features you’ve been waiting for. We have a new and much stronger foundation which is better designed for our future plans, so development will move much faster now.</p>
<p>We did some cool things technically to make Moo.do this fast, which we will detail in a future post. So we’ll end this one with the usual list of things we’re working on next.</p>
<h1 id="in-development">In Development</h1>

<li>Gmail integration</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Recent Roadmap Changes]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We’ve spent the past month working on improving Moo.do’s performance, based on your feedback and to get ready for the Gmail and Google Calendar integrations. We found a way to dramatically improve Moo.do’s speed and load time, but the changes required ended up being larger than expected. The delay is totally worth it though, as Moo.do will soon be able to handle tens of thousands of items with ease and feel much snappier overall. This update will improve our apps on all platforms: web, Chrome, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p>After this performance upgrade, we plan to spend some time working on some of the most requested features before starting the next big project that is the Gmail plugin.</p>
<p>We want to be totally transparent about what we’re working on, and we know we haven’t been as good about that as we should be. So we’re going to post updates on our blog more often about what we’re doing and what is coming. To get that started, this is an overview of how we expect to spend the next few months:</p>
<h2 id="upcoming-roadmap">Upcoming roadmap</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finish the performance upgrade</li>
<li>Important and highly requested features:<ul>
<li>Google Calendar sync</li>
<li>Improved search UI</li>
<li>Improved Agenda: Making it directly editable, showing context of what list an item is in, showing the children of an item</li>
<li>Notes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start on Gmail plugin</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Google Drive and Premium]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>For the past six months since our public launch, we’ve focused on improving the free version of Moo.do, including what we believe are basic features that every productivity app needs to have for free: real-time collaboration, offline support, availability on every device, and no limits on usage. We really appreciate your feedback and support that has helped us shape Moo.do into a great tool for managing projects, tasks, and to-do lists. Now it’s time to make Moo.do into much more than just a to-do list app.</p>
<p>Moo.do was started with the goal of organizing everything in one place. The first step of that was to be great at organizing one thing, so Moo.do has thus far been an app for organizing lists of text. We’ve spent the past few months building a plugin system that enables integration of all of the services you depend on into one organization system.</p>
<h2 id="google-drive-integration">Google Drive Integration</h2>
<p>Today we’re launching Moo.do’s first plugin: Google Drive. You can view the entire contents of your Drive within Moo.do in the new Drive Pane, drag files or folders onto your lists, search and focus the Drive Panes on individual folders, and drag files from your computer right into your Moo.do lists. Drive files work just like any other text in Moo.do: you can prioritize, schedule, tag, complete, and star them.</p>
<p>Try this live demo to see how the new Drive Pane works:</p>
<div class="twoPane demobg">
    <div id="demoPremium"></div>
</div>

<h2 id="premium">Premium</h2>
<p>Together with the Drive plugin, we’re launching our Premium plan. All of the features currently available in Moo.do will remain free, but premium users will have access to the new Drive plugin as well as <a href="https://www.moo.do/premium/">many more Premium features</a> in the future. To celebrate the Premium launch, we have special Early Adopter pricing of $4.95 / month, a 30% discount from the regular price. If you sign up now, you get Early Adopter pricing for life! You can sign up for Premium and get discounts for inviting your friends from the settings menu in the desktop version of Moo.do.</p>
<h2 id="discounts-for-inviting-friends">Discounts for inviting friends</h2>
<p>You get 20% off of your Premium plan for every friend you invite that signs up. You can stack that discount as many times as you want, so if 20 of your friends sign up for Moo.do, you’ll get 4 months for free! The friends you invite also get their first month of Moo.do Premium for free, so everyone wins :).</p>
<h2 id="help-us-grow">Help us grow</h2>
<p>We really appreciate your support in becoming a Premium user and inviting your friends, which helps us get our new features and integrations into your hands as quickly as possible. Thank you!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Moo.do & Mailbird]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We just launched a deep integration with <a href="http://www.getmailbird.com">Mailbird 2.0</a>, which is (in our humble opinions) the best email app for Windows. With Mailbird and Moo.do, email becomes a real to-do list that you can organize, prioritize, and schedule right alongside all your other projects and tasks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.getmailbird.com"><img src="https://www.moo.do/img/mailbird.png" /></a></p>
<p>Moo.do is built into <a href="http://www.getmailbird.com">Mailbird 2.0</a> as a dedicated sidebar, so you can drag your emails from Mailbird right into your Moo.do lists. It’s also an app inside Mailbird for a full-screen view of your Moo.do workflow. You can easily open emails from your task list: click an email in Moo.do and Mailbird opens it for you.</p>
<p>Organizing email and tasks together has completely transformed the way we use email. We don’t have to manually write down emails that need follow up. We don’t miss important emails because we can prioritize and schedule them alongside our other tasks and appointments.</p>
<p>We’re super excited about this integration with Mailbird and we hope it makes you less frustrated and more productive!</p>
<p>Get Mailbird 2.0 at <a href="http://www.getmailbird.com">http://www.getmailbird.com</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We are very happy to announce the next big step for Moo.do, and the reason we created Moo.do in the first place. You will soon be able to <strong>organize your email</strong> in Moo.do.</p>
<h2 id="email">Email</h2>
<p>We are making Moo.do a full email application for Gmail and also integrating it into other email apps, starting with <a href="http://www.getmailbird.com">Mailbird</a>, a fantastic email app for Windows.</p>
<p>Emails work just like everything else in Moo.do: you can prioritize, schedule, tag, complete, and star your emails. Scheduled and prioritized emails show up in your agenda so you know what emails to deal with next. You can organize emails into your projects and put them right on your to-do lists. Search filters emails the same way as tasks, so it fits right into your workflow.</p>
<div class="twoPane demobg">
    <div id="demoInboxZero" class="noInteractive"></div>
</div>

<h2 id="google-drive">Google Drive</h2>
<p>In addition to email, you can organize your Google Drive files and documents in your lists. If you drag a file from your computer into a Moo.do list, it will upload to Drive for you. Or if it’s already in Drive, Moo.do will find it and link to it.</p>
<h2 id="mailbird">Mailbird</h2>
<p>Moo.do is built into <a href="http://www.getmailbird.com">Mailbird 2.0</a> as a dedicated sidebar, so you can drag your emails from Mailbird right into your Moo.do lists. See more about Mailbird at <a href="http://getmailbird.com">http://getmailbird.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="try-it-now">Try it now</h2>
<p>We’ve updated our <a href="http://www.moo.do/">landing page</a> with live demos of how email and file organization work, so please try it out and let us know what you think!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Repeated Dates Update 11/21]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We’ve added support for repeated dates!</p>
<p>You can add a repeating date to an item by starting the date entry with <b class="date">@every</b>. We’re quite excited to add this feature as it makes our Agenda significantly more powerful. We hope you find this useful - let us know if you have any suggestions or if we’re missing any types of dates you need.</p>
<h2 id="using-repeated-dates">Using Repeated Dates</h2>
<p>Define a basic repeating date using a day of the week or a measure of time.</p>
<ul>
<li><b class="date">@every friday</b></li>
<li><b class="date">@every day 3:00pm</b></li>
<li><b class="date">@every 3 days</b></li>
</ul>
<p>By default the start of the repeat date is the current time. Use <b class="tag">from</b> to set a different start date.</p>
<ul>
<li><b class="date">@every friday from last wednesday</b></li>
<li><b class="date">@every tuesday from 11/22</b></li>
</ul>
<p>By default there is no end date specified. Use <b class="tag">until</b> to set an end date.</p>
<ul>
<li><b class="date">@every friday until december</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Create more complex repeating dates that refer to a specific day of the month.</p>
<ul>
<li><b class="date">@every 14th</b></li>
<li><b class="date">@every last day</b></li>
<li><b class="date">@every dec 10th</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Specify dates that skip weeks or only refer to specific weeks in a month.</p>
<ul>
<li><b class="date">@every other friday</b></li>
<li><b class="date">@every 3rd friday</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Each time you complete the item with the repeated date it will create a new item with the date of the completed instance.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="complete">Stay organized <b>@11/19</b></span></li>
<li>Stay organized <b class="date">@every day from 11/20</b></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-date-fixes">Other Date Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dates like <b class="date">@next friday 3pm</b> are parsed correctly.</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Launch]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We are proud to officially announce the launch of <strong>Moo.do</strong> at <a href="https://www.moo.do/">https://moo.do</a> and on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/web/moo.do-organize-your-way/id889830074?ls=1&amp;mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moo.do">Android</a>, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moodo/iffimmolghilclfndeiebgppddmagofk">Chrome</a> App Stores. <strong>Moo.do</strong> is designed to be the best and easiest way to organize everything in your life: projects, to-do lists, appointments, contacts, reminders, events, and anything else you can write down. As all modern apps should be, <strong>Moo.do</strong> is available on any computer, tablet, or phone and synchronizes all devices and users in realtime.</p>
<p>Throughout the development process we have been using <strong>Moo.do</strong> as our only tool for <a href="https://www.moo.do/blog/public-beta">planning, bug tracking, scheduling, and release tracking</a>. At the same time we have been using it to manage other projects, travel plans, and our day-to-day lives. Many of our beta testers have switched to using <strong>Moo.do</strong> as their primary organization system. Today we are happy to bring the power and simplicity of <strong>Moo.do</strong> to everyone.</p>
<p>As of today <strong>Moo.do</strong> is accessible on the iOS, Android, and Chrome App Stores and as a full-featured web app at <a href="https://www.moo.do/">https://moo.do</a>. Apps for Windows Phone, Windows 8, and Mac OS X will follow shortly.</p>
<p>We hope that <strong>Moo.do</strong> will help you organize your life and keep you on track. If you have feedback, questions, or would like to request a feature - get in touch, we would love to help you out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Public Beta]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce that <strong>Moo.do</strong> is entering into public beta today at <a href="https://www.moo.do/">https://moo.do</a>. <strong>Moo.do</strong> lets you organize your life as easily as writing on a piece of paper. <strong>Moo.do</strong> organizes your projects, to do lists, calendar, contacts, reminders, events, and anything else you can write down. It is flexible, available offline, works on your mobile devices, and synchronizes in realtime with all your devices and other collaborators. You can even share specific lists with your friends, group members or co-workers.</p>
<p>Two years ago we found ourselves and our friends frustrated with the difficulty of organizing and prioritizing multiple personal and work projects. We started working towards creating a tool that could be both powerful and easy to use.</p>
<p>As of today <strong>Moo.do</strong> is accessible to anyone by opening <a href="https://www.moo.do/">https://moo.do</a> on in a browser on your computer, iPhone, iPad, or Android device. In the near future native applications will be available for each platform, but you don’t have to wait for them as the mobile web app is fully featured.</p>
<p>We hope that <strong>Moo.do</strong> will help you organize your life and keep you on track. If you have feedback, questions, or would like to request a feature - get in touch, we would love to help you out.</p>
