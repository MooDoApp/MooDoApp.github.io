      <title>Editable Agenda</title>
      <link>http://www.moo.do/blog/editable-agenda</link>
      <description><![CDATA[We wanted the Agenda to be editable from the beginning, but it hasn&#39;t been possible to make it a good experience until the changes we made in our performance update. With that done, we are happy to announce that items in the Agenda pane are now editable!

To make editing in the Agenda pane feel good, items need to move gracefully as their dates and priorities change instead of jumping around or disappearing completely if a date is invalid. We achieve this by:


Delaying moving an Agenda item until a different item is selected
Animating the item into its new position to make it clear what is changing.




Another benefit of being able to animate items as their positions change is that it makes it clearer what is happening during search. Also it looks really cool :).



This is important for the Google Calendar plugin to work well because it will allow you to change your Google Calendar event names or dates/times right in the Agenda. We&#39;re doing final testing of the Google Calendar plugin now, so you&#39;ll see it soon!

      <link>http://www.moo.do/blog/revision-history</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The most important feature of a productivity app is that it never lose your data, which is why we designed Moo.do so that losing data is not even possible. Moo.do keeps a full revision history of all changes so that if anything goes wrong, everything can always be recovered. We just released a new tool for browsing your revision history to get back anything you may have lost. If you ever need to get something back, you can either revert to a previous version or copy and paste what you need back into Moo.do.

You can find Revision History in the options menu below Export Data. If you have any trouble with this tool, please let us know. Nobody has ever lost data in Moo.do and we plan to keep it that way.

      <title>Performance Upgrade</title>
      <link>http://www.moo.do/blog/performance</link>
      <description><![CDATA[We just launched a huge performance upgrade for Moo.do which dramatically reduces load time and makes interaction feel much snappier. This update improves Moo.do everywhere: on the web, Chrome, iOS, and Android.

We&#39;re serious when we say this is a huge upgrade. Check it out:


    
    
    


This update was an unexpected delay in our roadmap. As we got into the development of the Gmail plugin and began loading our inboxes into Moo.do, we realized we could not provide a good email experience until we fixed the performance problems. Moo.do was fast with a few hundred items, but as documents grew over time, Moo.do was unable to keep up. It was especially noticeable with the mobile apps, which were basically unusable with large documents. Adding large email inboxes into the mix made it clear that we had to focus on performance before we could continue.

Now, Moo.do is snappy even with tens of thousands of items. And now that this big change is done, we&#39;re back to building the features you&#39;ve been waiting for. We have a new and much stronger foundation which is better designed for our future plans, so development will move much faster now.

We did some cool things technically to make Moo.do this fast, which we will detail in a future post. So we&#39;ll end this one with the usual list of things we&#39;re working on next.

      <title>Recent Roadmap Changes</title>
      <link>http://www.moo.do/blog/updated-roadmap</link>
      <description><![CDATA[We&#39;ve spent the past month working on improving Moo.do&#39;s performance, based on your feedback and to get ready for the Gmail and Google Calendar integrations. We found a way to dramatically improve Moo.do&#39;s speed and load time, but the changes required ended up being larger than expected. The delay is totally worth it though, as Moo.do will soon be able to handle tens of thousands of items with ease and feel much snappier overall. This update will improve our apps on all platforms: web, Chrome, iOS, and Android.

After this performance upgrade, we plan to spend some time working on some of the most requested features before starting the next big project that is the Gmail plugin.

We want to be totally transparent about what we&#39;re working on, and we know we haven&#39;t been as good about that as we should be. So we&#39;re going to post updates on our blog more often about what we&#39;re doing and what is coming. To get that started, this is an overview of how we expect to spend the next few months:

Upcoming roadmap


Finish the performance upgrade (maybe about two weeks)
Important and highly requested features:


Google Calendar sync
Improved search UI
Improved Agenda: Making it directly editable, showing context of what list an item is in, showing the children of an item
Notes

Start on Gmail plugin

      <title>Google Drive and Premium</title>
      <link>http://www.moo.do/blog/premium</link>
      <description><![CDATA[For the past six months since our public launch, we&#39;ve focused on improving the free version of Moo.do, including what we believe are basic features that every productivity app needs to have for free: real-time collaboration, offline support, availability on every device, and no limits on usage. We really appreciate your feedback and support that has helped us shape Moo.do into a great tool for managing projects, tasks, and to-do lists. Now it’s time to make Moo.do into much more than just a to-do list app.

Moo.do was started with the goal of organizing everything in one place. The first step of that was to be great at organizing one thing, so Moo.do has thus far been an app for organizing lists of text. We&#39;ve spent the past few months building a plugin system that enables integration of all of the services you depend on into one organization system.

Google Drive Integration

Today we&#39;re launching Moo.do&#39;s first plugin: Google Drive. You can view the entire contents of your Drive within Moo.do in the new Drive Pane, drag files or folders onto your lists, search and focus the Drive Panes on individual folders, and drag files from your computer right into your Moo.do lists. Drive files work just like any other text in Moo.do: you can prioritize, schedule, tag, complete, and star them.

Try this live demo to see how the new Drive Pane works:


    


Premium

Together with the Drive plugin, we&#39;re launching our Premium plan. All of the features currently available in Moo.do will remain free, but premium users will have access to the new Drive plugin as well as many more Premium features in the future. To celebrate the Premium launch, we have special Early Adopter pricing of $4.95 / month, a 30% discount from the regular price. If you sign up now, you get Early Adopter pricing for life! You can sign up for Premium and get discounts for inviting your friends from the settings menu in the desktop version of Moo.do.

Discounts for inviting friends

You get 20% off of your Premium plan for every friend you invite that signs up. You can stack that discount as many times as you want, so if 20 of your friends sign up for Moo.do, you&#39;ll get 4 months for free! The friends you invite also get their first month of Moo.do Premium for free, so everyone wins :).

Help us grow

We really appreciate your support in becoming a Premium user and inviting your friends, which helps us get our new features and integrations into your hands as quickly as possible. Thank you!

      <title>Moo.do & Mailbird</title>
      <link>http://www.moo.do/blog/mailbird-launch</link>
      <description><![CDATA[We just launched a deep integration with Mailbird 2.0, which is (in our humble opinions) the best email app for Windows. With Mailbird and Moo.do, email becomes a real to-do list that you can organize, prioritize, and schedule right alongside all your other projects and tasks.



Moo.do is built into Mailbird 2.0 as a dedicated sidebar, so you can drag your emails from Mailbird right into your Moo.do lists. It&#39;s also an app inside Mailbird for a full-screen view of your Moo.do workflow. You can easily open emails from your task list: click an email in Moo.do and Mailbird opens it for you.

Organizing email and tasks together has completely transformed the way we use email. We don&#39;t have to manually write down emails that need follow up. We don&#39;t miss important emails because we can prioritize and schedule them alongside our other tasks and appointments.

We&#39;re super excited about this integration with Mailbird and we hope it makes you less frustrated and more productive!

Get Mailbird 2.0 at http://www.getmailbird.com.

      <title>Announcing Gmail and Drive Integration</title>
      <link>http://www.moo.do/blog/announcing-email</link>
      <description><![CDATA[We are very happy to announce the next big step for Moo.do, and the reason we created Moo.do in the first place. You will soon be able to organize your email in Moo.do.

Email

We are making Moo.do a full email application for Gmail and also integrating it into other email apps, starting with Mailbird, a fantastic email app for Windows.

Emails work just like everything else in Moo.do: you can prioritize, schedule, tag, complete, and star your emails. Scheduled and prioritized emails show up in your agenda so you know what emails to deal with next. You can organize emails into your projects and put them right on your to-do lists. Search filters emails the same way as tasks, so it fits right into your workflow.


    


Google Drive

In addition to email, you can organize your Google Drive files and documents in your lists. If you drag a file from your computer into a Moo.do list, it will upload to Drive for you. Or if it&#39;s already in Drive, Moo.do will find it and link to it.

Mailbird

Moo.do is built into Mailbird 2.0 as a dedicated sidebar, so you can drag your emails from Mailbird right into your Moo.do lists. See more about Mailbird at http://getmailbird.com.





Try it now

We&#39;ve updated our landing page with live demos of how email and file organization work, so please try it out and let us know what you think!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are very happy to announce the next big step for Moo.do, and the reason we created Moo.do in the first place. You will soon be able to <strong>organize your email</strong> in Moo.do.</p>

<h2>Email</h2>

<p>We are making Moo.do a full email application for Gmail and also integrating it into other email apps, starting with <a href="http://www.getmailbird.com">Mailbird</a>, a fantastic email app for Windows.</p>

<p>Emails work just like everything else in Moo.do: you can prioritize, schedule, tag, complete, and star your emails. Scheduled and prioritized emails show up in your agenda so you know what emails to deal with next. You can organize emails into your projects and put them right on your to-do lists. Search filters emails the same way as tasks, so it fits right into your workflow.</p>

<div class="twoPane demobg">
    <div id="demoInboxZero" class="noInteractive"></div>
</div>

<h2>Google Drive</h2>

<p>In addition to email, you can organize your Google Drive files and documents in your lists. If you drag a file from your computer into a Moo.do list, it will upload to Drive for you. Or if it&#39;s already in Drive, Moo.do will find it and link to it.</p>

<h2>Mailbird</h2>

<p>Moo.do is built into <a href="http://www.getmailbird.com">Mailbird 2.0</a> as a dedicated sidebar, so you can drag your emails from Mailbird right into your Moo.do lists. See more about Mailbird at <a href="http://getmailbird.com">http://getmailbird.com</a>.</p>

<!-- ## Moo.do Premium -->

<!-- We are also announcing our business model. Everything that is already in Moo.do will stay free, and we will have a Premium subscription of $7 per month for the premium integrations: Gmail, Drive, Calendar, and more to come. You can learn more about our pricing [here](/pricing/). -->

<h2>Try it now</h2>

<p>We&#39;ve updated our <a href="http://www.moo.do/">landing page</a> with live demos of how email and file organization work, so please try it out and let us know what you think!</p>

Design


The options and documents previously available in the sidebar are now accessible from the documents menu in the top left and the options gear in the top right.
The search bar at the top of panes has been toned down and integrated into the pane to help show the connection between search and your content.
Adding panes is now accessible through the + icon in the top right. This is the first step towards adding additional types of panes in the future.
Reduced visual distraction from the top-bar by removing the background color.

      <title>Repeated Dates Update 11/21</title>
      <link>http://www.moo.do/blog/update-repeat-dates</link>
      <description><![CDATA[We&#39;ve added support for repeated dates!

You can add a repeating date to an item by starting the date entry with @every. We&#39;re quite excited to add this feature as it makes our Agenda significantly more powerful. We hope you find this useful - let us know if you have any suggestions or if we&#39;re missing any types of dates you need.

Using Repeated Dates

Define a basic repeating date using a day of the week or a measure of time.


@every friday
@every day 3:00pm
@every 3 days


By default the start of the repeat date is the current time. Use from to set a different start date.


@every friday from last wednesday
@every tuesday from 11/22


By default there is no end date specified. Use until to set an end date.


@every friday until december


Create more complex repeating dates that refer to a specific day of the month.


@every 14th
@every last day
@every dec 10th


Specify dates that skip weeks or only refer to specific weeks in a month.


@every other friday
@every 3rd friday


Each time you complete the item with the repeated date it will create a new item with the date of the completed instance.


Stay organized @11/19
Stay organized @every day from 11/20


Other Date Fixes


Dates like @next friday 3pm are parsed correctly.

      <description><![CDATA[We are proud to officially announce the launch of Moo.do at https://moo.do and on the iOS, Android, and Chrome App Stores. Moo.do is designed to be the best and easiest way to organize everything in your life: projects, to-do lists, appointments, contacts, reminders, events, and anything else you can write down. As all modern apps should be, Moo.do is available on any computer, tablet, or phone and synchronizes all devices and users in realtime.

Throughout the development process we have been using Moo.do as our only tool for planning, bug tracking, scheduling, and release tracking. At the same time we have been using it to manage other projects, travel plans, and our day-to-day lives. Many of our beta testers have switched to using Moo.do as their primary organization system. Today we are happy to bring the power and simplicity of Moo.do to everyone.

As of today Moo.do is accessible on the iOS, Android, and Chrome App Stores and as a full-featured web app at https://moo.do. Apps for Windows Phone, Windows 8, and Mac OS X will follow shortly.

We hope that Moo.do will help you organize your life and keep you on track. If you have feedback, questions, or would like to request a feature - get in touch, we would love to help you out.

      <description><![CDATA[Many friends of Moo.do like to organize their projects on a Scrum (or Kanban) board for Agile Development. This continues our series of examples of how people and teams are using Moo.do with a description of how Moo.do can be used as a Scrum board. While we appreciate the physicality of plastering notes on a wall, we think powerful software is much more effective and less messy.

<p>This outline format is a great way to read through everything, but it gets hard to read when there&#39;s a lot of items in each list. So let&#39;s spread them out by adding more panes, with one focused on each list.</p>

<div class="unpadded">
    <div class="threePanes demobg">
        <div id="demoThreePanes"></div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption noMobile">This is a fully interactive instance of <b>Moo.do</b>. Try dragging items between panes by grabbing the space to the left of an item.</div>

<p>It&#39;s easy to visualize how much work is left in each phase and drag and drop items between panes as we make progress. Now that the basics are set up, let&#39;s look at what else <strong>Moo.do</strong> can do!</p>

<h1>Assign tasks</h1>

<p>Our team assigns tasks using a <b class="tag">#tag</b> for each person. I use <strong>Moo.do</strong>&#39;s search to view only my tasks or see what others on my team are working on.</p>

<div class="twoPane demobg">
    <div id="demoAssign"></div>
</div>

<h1>See what&#39;s important</h1>

<p>&quot;What Do I Do Next Paralysis&quot; can be a big problem when faced with a lot of tasks. Being able to quickly prioritize using <strong>Moo.do</strong>&#39;s starring and three priority levels makes it easy to always know what&#39;s next and what needs further discussion. During our meetings, we open an Agenda pane and talk through starred items and check up on high priority tasks. We can even focus and search the Agenda.</p>

<div class="twoPane demobg">
    <div id="demoAgenda"></div>
</div>

<h1>My to-do list</h1>

<p>I use <strong>Moo.do</strong>&#39;s&#39; powerful search to focus on just what I need.</p>

<table class="searchList">
<tr><td><b class="p0">!!!</b> -//</td><td>Important and incomplete items</td></tr>
<tr><td><b class="tag">#Grant</b> //</td><td>What Grant has finished</td></tr>
<tr><td><b class="tag">#iPhone</b></td><td>What needs to be fixed for iPhone</td></tr>
<tr><td><b class="tag">#Feedback</b> -#</td><td>Unassigned feedback</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It&#39;s great to have an overview of what everyone is doing, but it&#39;s very distracting (and scary!) to stare at it all day long. I check the overall list in the morning or evening and spend the day focused on my own tasks by searching for only tasks assigned to me, or even only my highest priority tasks.</p>

<div class="twoPane demobg">
    <div id="demoPersonal"></div>
</div>

<h1>Show a dashboard on a TV</h1>

<p>Many people like to have a scrum board on a wall in a central location that everyone can see. <strong>Moo.do</strong> is synchronized in real time as you type, so with <strong>Moo.do</strong> on a TV in the office, you&#39;ll see tasks getting moved around and completed as people work on them. You could have one pane showing what&#39;s happening in the &quot;In Progress&quot; section, one showing an agenda of the highest priority tasks, and one tracking finished tasks in the &quot;Complete&quot; section.</p>

      <title>Moo.do for Project Management</title>
      <link>http://www.moo.do/blog/project-management</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Moo.do is designed to be extremely flexible. Our goal is to allow anyone to organize in a way that makes the most sense for them. While building Moo.do, we&#39;ve been using it to manage its own development: as a planner, project manager, todo list, calendar, and bug tracker. I&#39;ll describe how we use Moo.do as the first of a series of examples of how people and teams are using Moo.do.

We have spent a majority of the development process working remotely and in vastly different time zones, so making sure we know what to work on next without additional communication is especially important.

We found traditional systems for project management and bug tracking to be too heavy. We wasted our time fighting software and waiting for pages to load, so we designed Moo.do to be a powerful tool for managing a project and tracking its bugs while taking a content first approach with a minimalist UI. At Moo.do, we use our own product to organize everything about itself: features, bugs, ideas, marketing, and feedback. Today I&#39;ll focus on how we manage feature planning, bugs, and managing product ideas.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moo.do</strong> is designed to be extremely flexible. Our goal is to allow anyone to organize in a way that makes the most sense for them. While building <strong>Moo.do</strong>, we&#39;ve been using it to manage its own development: as a planner, project manager, todo list, calendar, and bug tracker. I&#39;ll describe how we use <strong>Moo.do</strong> as the first of a series of <a href="/blog/ideas">examples of how people and teams are using <strong>Moo.do</strong></a>.</p>

<p>We have spent a majority of the development process working remotely and in vastly different time zones, so making sure we know what to work on next without additional communication is especially important.</p>

<p>We found traditional systems for project management and bug tracking to be too heavy. We wasted our time fighting software and waiting for pages to load, so we designed <strong>Moo.do</strong> to be a powerful tool for managing a project and tracking its bugs while taking a content first approach with a minimalist UI. At <strong>Moo.do</strong>, we use our own product to organize everything about itself: features, bugs, ideas, marketing, and feedback. Today I&#39;ll focus on how we manage feature planning, bugs, and managing product ideas.</p>

<h1>Organization</h1>

<p>At the beginning of a milestone, we discuss the main goals we want to accomplish and lay out a basic plan separated into distinct groups.</p>

<div class="onePane demobg" id="wrapOrg">
    <div id="demoOrganization"></div>
</div>

<p>As we progress through the milestone, we mark tasks complete and add new bugs under Major and Minor Bugs. At the end of a milestone, we drag and drop tasks that did not get completed into the next release, and discuss what features and bugs from Future we want to bring in. Then we mark the current release complete and move onto the next one.</p>

<h1>Prioritizing and Starring</h1>

<p>We use the three priority levels in <strong>Moo.do</strong> to describe how soon we should deal with tasks. For us, <span class="p0">high priority</span> means that it should be handled immediately, while <span class="p1">lower priorities</span> are more important than most things, but can wait. We use <span class="pStar">starring to highlight things</span> for the other person to look at.</p>

<p>When I look over what to do for the day, I mark what tasks I&#39;m planning to do today as <span class="p0">high priority</span> to make them easy to find. Grant prefers to prioritize based on severity, marking the scariest bugs as <span class="p0">high priority</span> so he&#39;ll keep thinking about them.</p>

<h1>Tagging</h1>

<p>We use tags to assign tasks, group related tasks together, or mark for future action.</p>

<table class="tagsList">
<tr><td>#Grant</td><td>Assigned to Grant</td></tr>
<tr><td>#J</td><td>Assigned to Jay</td></tr>
<tr><td>#Discuss</td><td>To discuss in our next phone call</td></tr>
<tr><td>#punt</td><td>Delay until the next milestone</td></tr>
<tr><td>#watch</td><td>Bug that's hard to reproduce - keep an eye on it</td></tr>
</table>

<h1>Searching</h1>

<p>This is where Moo.do is incredibly powerful. Between all the features, bugs, ideas, marketing plans, and user feedback, we have thousands of lines of data. Search lets us focus on what&#39;s important right now.</p>

<ul>
<li>We can start a search with <span class="search">-</span> to hide irrelevant items, and we can combine that with <span class="search">//</span>, the search shorthand for &#39;complete,&#39; to hide completed items.</li>
<li>We search for <span class="search">-// -<span class="tag">#punt</span></span> to hide all completed and postponed tasks.</li>
<li>If I want to see everything assigned to me, I search for <span class="search"><span class="tag">#J</span></span></li>
<li>To see my todo list for the day, I search for <span class="search"><span class="tag">#J</span> <span class="p0 b">!!</span></span> to show only tasks assigned to me of at least medium priority.</li>
<li>When we get on the phone we both search for <span class="search"><span class="tag">#Discuss</span></span> and go down the list together.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Multiple Panes</h1>

<p>It is often quite useful to look at the same data in different ways. A nice way to use search in <strong>Moo.do</strong> is to have multiple panes open with different searches. Hiding completed and punted tasks shows what&#39;s left.</p>

<div class="twoPane demobg" id="wrapPanes1">
    <div id="demoPanes1"></div>
</div>

<div class="caption noMobile">This is a fully interactive instance of <b>Moo.do</b>. Try your own searches like <span class="search">-//</span> or <span class="search"><span class="p0 b">!!!</span></span>.</div>

<h1>Focus On You</h1>

<p>I like to use <strong>Moo.do</strong> full-screen with three panes open at once:</p>

<ul>
<li>Searched for <span class="search">-// -<span class="tag">#punt</span></span> as shown above. This is where I add, edit, and assign features or bugs. I can add to the current release or scroll down and add them to the next one.</li>
<li>Focused on this release and searched for <span class="search">-// -<span class="tag">#punt #J</span></span> to see my tasks.</li>
<li>Focused on this release and searched for <span class="search">-// -<span class="tag">#punt #J</span> <span class="p0 b">!!</span></span> which is my todo list for the day.</li>
</ul>

<div class="twoPane demobg" id="wrapPanes2">
    <div id="demoPanes2"></div>
</div>

<div class="caption noMobile">This is a fully interactive instance of <b>Moo.do</b>. Try your own searches like <span class="search"><span class="tag">#Grant</span></span> to see Grant's tasks.</div>

<h1>Progress Tracking</h1>

<p><strong>Moo.do</strong> keeps track of when items are completed, which has a variety of uses for project management.</p>

<ul>
<li>When I start work for the day, I can see what Grant finished the day before.</li>
<li>When I finish a day&#39;s work, I like to look over what I got done.</li>
<li>We can look through the past couple of weeks and get a feel for how quickly we&#39;re moving.</li>
</ul>

<div class="onePane demobg" id="wrapAgenda">
    <div id="demoAgenda" class="demo"></div>
</div>

<h1>Discussion</h1>

<p>In some cases we want to add more information to a task, or I want to ask a question on a task Grant added. To add details to a bug or feature, ask questions, add steps to reproduce a bug, or request a code review, we add a sub-item assigned to the other person with a tag, and star it to make it stand out. We often have short conversations as we try to reproduce a bug.</p>

<div class="onePane demobg" id="wrapDiscussion">
    <div id="demoDiscussion" class="demo"></div>
</div>

      <title>Public Beta</title>
      <link>http://www.moo.do/blog/public-beta</link>
      <description><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Moo.do is entering into public beta today at https://moo.do. Moo.do lets you organize your life as easily as writing on a piece of paper. Moo.do organizes your projects, to do lists, calendar, contacts, reminders, events, and anything else you can write down. It is flexible, available offline, works on your mobile devices, and synchronizes in realtime with all your devices and other collaborators. You can even share specific lists with your friends, group members or co-workers.

Two years ago we found ourselves and our friends frustrated with the difficulty of organizing and prioritizing multiple personal and work projects. We started working towards creating a tool that could be both powerful and easy to use.

As of today Moo.do is accessible to anyone by opening https://moo.do on in a browser on your computer, iPhone, iPad, or Android device. In the near future native applications will be available for each platform, but you don’t have to wait for them as the mobile web app is fully featured.

We hope that Moo.do will help you organize your life and keep you on track. If you have feedback, questions, or would like to request a feature - get in touch, we would love to help you out.
