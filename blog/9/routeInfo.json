Our goal is to allow anyone to organize in a way that makes the most sense for them. While building <strong>Moo.do</strong>, we’ve been using it to manage its own development: as a planner, project manager, todo list, calendar, and bug tracker. I’ll describe how we use <strong>Moo.do</strong> as the first of a series of <a href=\"/blog/ideas\">examples of how people and teams are using <strong>Moo.do</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>We have spent a majority of the development process working remotely and in vastly different time zones, so making sure we know what to work on next without additional communication is especially important.</p>\n<p>##EXCERPT##</p>\n<p class=\"noMobile\">Note: These examples all live demos of <b>Moo.do</b> itself, so you can interact with them.</p>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"organization\">Organization</h1>\n<p>At the beginning of a milestone, we discuss the main goals we want to accomplish and lay out a basic plan separated into distinct groups.</p>\n<div class=\"onePane demobg\" id=\"wrapOrg\">\n    <div id=\"demoOrganization\"></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>As we progress through the milestone, we mark tasks complete and add new bugs under Major and Minor Bugs. At the end of a milestone, we drag and drop tasks that did not get completed into the next release, and discuss what features and bugs from Future we want to bring in. Then we mark the current release complete and move onto the next one.</p>\n<h1 id=\"prioritizing-and-starring\">Prioritizing and Starring</h1>\n<p>We use the three priority levels in <strong>Moo.do</strong> to describe how soon we should deal with tasks. For us, <span class=\"p0\"><strong>high priority</strong></span> means that it should be handled immediately, while <span class=\"p1\"><strong>lower priorities</strong></span> are more important than most things, but can wait. We use <span class=\"pStar\"><strong>starring to highlight things</strong></span> for the other person to look at.</p>\n<p>When I look over what to do for the day, I mark what tasks I’m planning to do today as <span class=\"p0\"><strong>high priority</strong></span> to make them easy to find.</p>\n<h1 id=\"tagging\">Tagging</h1>\n<p>We use tags to assign tasks, group related tasks together, or mark for future action.</p>\n<table class=\"tagsList\">\n<tr><td>#G</td><td>Assigned to Grant</td></tr>\n<tr><td>#J</td><td>Assigned to Jay</td></tr>\n<tr><td>#test</td><td>Done, needs testing</td></tr>\n<tr><td>#feedback</td><td>Needs feedback</td></tr>\n<tr><td>#ready</td><td>Ready for merge</td></tr>\n<tr><td>#b_foo</td><td>Task is completed in branch \"foo\"</td></tr>\n<tr><td>#discuss</td><td>To discuss in our next phone call</td></tr>\n<tr><td>#punt</td><td>Delay until the next milestone</td></tr>\n<tr><td>#watch</td><td>Bug that's hard to reproduce - keep an eye on it</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"searching\">Searching</h1>\n<p>This is where Moo.do is incredibly powerful. Between all the features, bugs, ideas, marketing plans, and user feedback, we have thousands of lines of data. Search lets us focus on what’s important right now.</p>\n<p>As an example, I have a pane with the following search to show me what I am doing today:</p>\n<center><img src=\"/blog/img/ideas-proj-man-search.png\" width=\"300px\" /></center>\n\n<table class=\"searchList tagsList\">\n<tr><td><span class=\"search\"><span class=\"tag\">#J</span></span></td><td>Shows only tasks assigned to me</td></tr>\n<tr><td><span class=\"search\"><span class=\"tag\">-#punt</span></span></td><td>Hides all postponed tasks</td></tr>\n<tr><td><img src=\"/blog/img/ideas-no-complete.png\" width=\"28px\" /></td><td>Hides completed tasks</td></tr>\n<tr><td><img src=\"/blog/img/ideas-pri-med.png\" width=\"46px\" /></td><td>Shows tasks of at least medium priority</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h1 id=\"multiple-panes\">Multiple Panes</h1>\n<p>It is often quite useful to look at the same data in different ways. A nice way to use search in <strong>Moo.do</strong> is to have multiple panes open with different searches. Hiding completed and punted tasks shows what’s left.</p>\n<div class=\"twoPane demobg\" id=\"wrapPanes1\">\n    <div id=\"demoPanes1\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"caption noMobile\">This is a fully interactive instance of <b>Moo.do</b>. Try your own searches like <span class=\"tag\">#Grant</span> or <span class=\"tag\">#J</span>.</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"focus-on-you\">Focus On You</h1>\n<p>I like to use <strong>Moo.do</strong> full-screen with three panes open at once:</p>\n<ul class=\"searchList\">\n<li>Searched for <span class=\"search border\">-<span class=\"tag\">#punt</span><img src=\"/blog/img/ideas-no-complete.png\" width=\"28px\" /></span> as shown above. This is where I add, edit, and assign features or bugs. I can add to the current release or scroll down and add them to the next one.</li>\n<li>Focused on this release and searched for <span class=\"search border\">-<span class=\"tag\">#J -#punt</span><img src=\"/blog/img/ideas-no-complete.png\" width=\"28px\" /></span> to see my tasks.</li>\n<li>Focused on this release and searched for <span class=\"search border\">-<span class=\"tag\">#J -#punt</span><img src=\"/blog/img/ideas-pri-med.png\" width=\"46px\" /></span> which is my todo list for the day.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"twoPane demobg\" id=\"wrapPanes2\">\n    <div id=\"demoPanes2\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"caption noMobile\">This is a fully interactive instance of <b>Moo.do</b>. Try your own searches like <span class=\"search\"><span class=\"tag\">#Grant</span></span> to see Grant's tasks.</div>\n\n<h1 id=\"discussion\">Discussion</h1>\n<p>In some cases we want to add more information to a task, or I want to ask a question on a task Grant added. To add details to a bug or feature, ask questions, add steps to reproduce a bug, or request a code review, we add a sub-item assigned to the other person with a tag, and star it to make it stand out. We often have short conversations as we try to reproduce a bug.</p>\n<div class=\"onePane demobg\" id=\"wrapDiscussion\">\n    <div id=\"demoDiscussion\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to see tips for how to organize your particular set of content, or have an interesting organization method that you use, send us an email at <a href=\"mailto:contact@moo.do\"> contact@moo.do</a>. We’d love to hear about what you do now or how you stay organized with <strong>Moo.do</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<style>\n    #post_proj-man .caption {\n        margin-top: -20px;\n        margin-bottom: 30px;\n        text-align: center;\n        font-size: 85%;\n    }\n    #post_proj-man .demo {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n        height: 100%;\n    }\n    #post_proj-man .demobg {\n        position: relative;\n        margin: 30px auto;\n        max-width: 100%;\n    }\n    html:not(.mobile) #post_proj-man .demobg {\n        height: 350px;\n        padding: 10px;\n    }\n    .mobile #post_proj-man .demobg {\n        padding: 5px;\n    }\n    #post_proj-man .threePanes:not(.demoimg) {\n        margin: 30px 20px;\n        height: 380px;\n    }\n    #post_proj-man .onePane:not(.demoimg) {\n        width: 410px;\n    }\n    #post_proj-man .twoPane:not(.demoimg) {\n        width: 820px;\n        margin-left: -22px;\n        max-width: -webkit-calc(100% + 44px);\n        max-width: calc(100% + 44px);\n    }\n    html:not(.mobile) #post_proj-man #wrapOrg:not(.demoimg) {\n        height: 570px;\n    }\n    html:not(.mobile) #post_proj-man #wrapPanes1:not(.demoimg) {\n        height: 720px;\n        padding: 10px 0;\n    }\n    html:not(.mobile) #post_proj-man #wrapPanes2:not(.demoimg) {\n        height: 490px;\n    }\n    html:not(.mobile) #post_proj-man #wrapAgenda:not(.demoimg) {\n        height: 320px;\n    }\n    html:not(.mobile) #post_proj-man #wrapDiscussion:not(.demoimg) {\n        width: 680px;\n        height: 450px;\n    }\n    #post_proj-man .demoimg {\n        width: 100%;\n        display: block;\n    }\n    html:not(.mobile) #post_proj-man .demo {\n        text-align: center;\n    }\n    #post_proj-man .tagsList td:first-child {\n        font-weight: bold;\n        padding-right: 20px;\n        color: #09d;\n    }\n</style>","script":"window.__addDemos(\n[\n    {\n        id: 'demoOrganization',\n        src: '/web/#demo=true&touch=false&data=blog-proj-man-1&dmode=0x29b&panes=1',\n    },\n    {\n        id: 'demoPanes1',\n        src: '/web/#demo=true&touch=false&data=blog-proj-man-2&panes=1,1:' + encodeURIComponent('-// -#punt') + ':-LxKk4h7dmVDBntSfBCJ&dmode=0x29b',\n    },\n    {\n        id: 'demoPanes2',\n        src: '/web/#demo=true&touch=false&data=blog-proj-man-2&panes=1:' + encodeURIComponent('-// -#punt #J') + ':-LxKk4h7dmVDBntSfBCJ,1:' + encodeURIComponent('-// -#punt #J !!') + ':-LxKk4h7dmVDBntSfBCJ&dmode=0x29b',\n    },\n    {\n        id: 'demoDiscussion',\n        src: '/web/#demo=true&touch=false&data=blog-proj-man-3&dmode=0x29b&panes=1',\n    }\n]);"},{"title":"Calendar Pane (Beta)","slug":"calendar-pane","category":"updates","date":"Sun Feb 19 2017 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","contents":"<p>Moo.do now has a full Calendar!
