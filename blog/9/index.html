Google Calendar is a Premium plugin and it is also available as a free trial to our Community Members (anyone who has invited 5 or more people).</p>\n<p>We are very excited to enable access to Google Calendar from Moo.do as this seamlessly integrates Moo.do with every calendar app out there. Moo.do and Google Calendar synchronize in both directions, meaning you can manage your calendar with Moo.do as well as work with your Moo.do events from your favorite Calendar app.</p>\n<p>This has been the most requested feature on our <a href=\"https://feedback.moo.do/forums/274238-general/suggestions/6889894-google-calender-sync\">feature requests page</a> and through our in-app feedback. Thank you to everyone who is helping to keep us pointed in the right direction to make everybody happier and more productive.</p>\n<p>Let’s get into how Moo.do’s Google Calendar plugin works:</p>\n<h1 id=\"choose-your-calendars\">Choose your calendars</h1>\n<p>Select all of the calendars you want to sync from and the one you want to sync to.</p>\n<img class=\"postImg postImgCalendar postImgCalendar2\" src=\"/img/about/GCalSettings.jpg\" />\n\n\n<h1 id=\"calendar-events-in-the-agenda\">Calendar events in the agenda</h1>\n<p>Your Google Calendar events are in your Agenda, marked by a <img class=\"postIconCalendar\" src=\"/blog/img/update-calendar1.png\" /> icon. You can edit existing events and add new events in the Agenda or you can drag them onto your lists. Use the <img class=\"postIconCalendar\" src=\"/blog/img/update-calendar1.png\" /> button in the search box to show or hide Calendar events.\n<img class=\"postImg postImgCalendar postImgCalendar3\" src=\"/blog/img/update-calendar3.png\" /></p>\n<h1 id=\"sync-your-events\">Sync your events</h1>\n<p>Press <span class=\"hotkeySec\">Ctrl + C</span> on an item with a <span class=\"date\">@date</span> and the event gets added to your calendar, with a <img class=\"postIconCalendar\" src=\"/blog/img/update-calendar1.png\" /> icon to show you that it’s synced. We don’t want to fill your calendar by automatically adding every <span class=\"date\">@date</span> item, but if you want to add many events to your calendar in bulk, you can highlight multiple items and press <span class=\"hotkeySec\">Ctrl + C</span> to add them all at once.</p>\n<h1 id=\"edit-events-anywhere-anytime\">Edit events anywhere, anytime</h1>\n<p>Moo.do syncs both ways, so you can edit events in Moo.do or in your calendar and they’ll stay in sync everywhere. You can also add or modify events while offline and they will sync when you go back online.</p>\n<h1 id=\"durations\">Durations</h1>\n<p>We’ve added support for durations for Calendar events. You can add an event with a duration formatted in many different ways.\n<img class=\"postImg postImgCalendar postImgCalendar4\" src=\"/blog/img/update-calendar4.png\" /></p>\n<h1 id=\"help-us-improve\">Help us improve</h1>\n<p>This is an Early Access release, meaning we want your feedback to get this feature right. Please let us know how you use your calendar with Moo.do and how we can make this integration better. We put a a feedback form in the Early Access section of the settings. Thank you!</p>\n<h1 id=\"in-development\">In Development</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Gmail Plugin</li>\n</ul>\n<style>\n.postIconCalendar {\n    height: 20px;\n    margin: 0 2px;\n    vertical-align: text-bottom;\n}\n.postImgCalendar {\n    margin: 40px auto;\n}\n.postImgCalendar2 {\n    width: 620px;\n}\n.postImgCalendar3 {\n    width: 360px;\n}\n.postImgCalendar4 {\n    width: 300px;\n}\n</style>\n"},{"title":"Search","slug":"search","category":"updates","date":"Mon Oct 26 2015 07:00:00 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time)","contents":"<p>Search is one of Moo.do’s most powerful features so we’ve upgraded it to be more intuitive and to support advanced search functions for our upcoming plugins.</p>\n<p>With the new search you can easily set a minimum priority and show or hide completed and starred items. You can toggle these filters with the same hotkeys that you use on your lists.</p>\n<img class=\"postImg postImgSearch\" src=\"/blog/img/update-search1.gif\" />\n\n<p>Searching for dates is more powerful and easier to use. Searching for a <span class=\"date\">@date</span> will match all items that fall on that date rather than just matching the text. For example, a search for <span class=\"date\">@tomorrow</span> will show items on <span class=\"date\">@10/27</span> or <span class=\"date\">@tuesday</span>.</p>\n<img class=\"postImg postImgSearch\" src=\"/blog/img/update-search2.png\" />\n\n<h1 id=\"in-development\">In Development</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Calendar sync</li>\n<li>Gmail integration</li>\n</ul>\n<style>\n.postImgSearch {\n    width: 400px;\n    margin: 40px auto;\n}\n</style>\n"},{"title":"Editable Agenda","slug":"editable-agenda","category":"updates","date":"Mon Oct 19 2015 07:00:00 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time)","contents":"<p>We wanted the Agenda to be editable from the beginning, but it hasn’t been possible to make it a good experience until the changes we made in our <a href=\"/blog/performance\">performance update</a>. With that done, we are happy to announce that items in the Agenda pane are now editable!</p>\n<p>To make editing in the Agenda pane feel good, items need to move gracefully as their dates and priorities change instead of jumping around or disappearing completely if a date is invalid. We achieve this by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delaying moving an Agenda item until a different item is selected</li>\n<li>Animating the item into its new position to make it clear what is changing.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"postImg postImgAgenda\" src=\"/blog/img/update-editable-agenda1.gif\" />\n\n<p>Another benefit of being able to animate items as their positions change is that it makes it clearer what is happening during search. Also it looks really cool :).</p>\n<img class=\"postImg postImgAgenda\" src=\"/blog/img/update-editable-agenda2.gif\" />\n\n<p>This is important for the Google Calendar plugin to work well because it will allow you to change your Google Calendar event names or dates/times right in the Agenda.

Moo.do keeps a full revision history of all changes so that if anything goes wrong, everything can always be recovered. We just released a new tool for browsing your revision history to get back anything you may have lost. If you ever need to get something back, you can either revert to a previous version or copy and paste what you need back into Moo.do.</p>\n<p>You can find Revision History in the options menu below Export Data. If you have any trouble with this tool, please let us know. Nobody has ever lost data in Moo.do and we plan to keep it that way.</p>\n"},{"title":"Performance Upgrade","slug":"performance","category":"updates","date":"Mon Sep 14 2015 07:00:00 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time)","contents":"<p>We just launched a <strong>huge</strong> performance upgrade for Moo.do which dramatically reduces load time and makes interaction feel much snappier. This update improves Moo.do everywhere: on the web, Chrome, iOS, and Android.</p>\n<p>We’re serious when we say this is a <strong>huge</strong> upgrade. Check it out:</p>\n<p>\n    <img class=\"postImg postImgPerf\" src=\"/blog/img/update-performance1.png\" />\n    <img class=\"postImg postImgPerf\" src=\"/blog/img/update-performance2.png\" />\n    <img class=\"postImg postImgPerf\" src=\"/blog/img/update-performance3.png\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>This update was an unexpected delay in our roadmap. As we got into the development of the Gmail plugin and began loading our inboxes into Moo.do, we realized we could not provide a good email experience until we fixed the performance problems. Moo.do was fast with a few hundred items, but as documents grew over time, Moo.do was unable to keep up. It was especially noticeable with the mobile apps, which were basically unusable with large documents. Adding large email inboxes into the mix made it clear that we had to focus on performance before we could continue.</p>\n<p>Now, Moo.do is snappy even with tens of thousands of items. And now that this big change is done, we’re back to building the features you’ve been waiting for. We have a new and much stronger foundation which is better designed for our future plans, so development will move much faster now.</p>\n<p>We did some cool things technically to make Moo.do this fast, which we will detail in a future post. So we’ll end this one with the usual list of things we’re working on next.</p>\n<h1 id=\"in-development\">In Development</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Calendar sync</li>\n<li>Gmail integration</li>\n</ul>\n<style>\n.postImgPerf {\n    width: 682px;\n    margin: 40px auto;\n}\n</style>\n"}],"numPages":12,"path":"/blog"},"siteData":{"title":"Moo.do"}};</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/bootstrap.719b87f6.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/main.c4d29d4d.js"></script></body></html>
