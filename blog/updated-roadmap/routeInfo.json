We found a way to dramatically improve Moo.do’s speed and load time, but the changes required ended up being larger than expected. The delay is totally worth it though, as Moo.do will soon be able to handle tens of thousands of items with ease and feel much snappier overall. This update will improve our apps on all platforms: web, Chrome, iOS, and Android.</p>\n<p>After this performance upgrade, we plan to spend some time working on some of the most requested features before starting the next big project that is the Gmail plugin.</p>\n<p>We want to be totally transparent about what we’re working on, and we know we haven’t been as good about that as we should be. So we’re going to post updates on our blog more often about what we’re doing and what is coming. To get that started, this is an overview of how we expect to spend the next few months:</p>\n<h2 id=\"upcoming-roadmap\">Upcoming roadmap</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Finish the performance upgrade</li>\n<li>Important and highly requested features:<ul>\n<li>Google Calendar sync</li>\n<li>Improved search UI</li>\n<li>Improved Agenda: Making it directly editable, showing context of what list an item is in, showing the children of an item</li>\n<li>Notes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Start on Gmail plugin</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"isSinglePost":true}}
