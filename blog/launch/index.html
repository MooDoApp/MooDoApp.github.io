Moo.do is designed to be the best and easiest way to organize everything in your life: projects, to-do lists, appointments, contacts, reminders, events, and anything else you can write down. As all modern apps should be, Moo.do is available on any computer, tablet, or phone and synchronizes all devices and users in realtime.

Throughout the development process we have been using Moo.do as our only tool for planning, bug tracking, scheduling, and release tracking. At the same time we have been using it to manage other projects, travel plans, and our day-to-day lives. Many of our beta testers have switched to using Moo.do as their primary organization system. Today we are happy to bring the power and simplicity of Moo.do to everyone.

As of today Moo.do is accessible on the iOS, Android, and Chrome App Stores and as a full-featured web app at https://moo.do. Apps for Windows Phone, Windows 8, and Mac OS X will follow shortly.

We hope that Moo.do will help you organize your life and keep you on track. If you have feedback, questions, or would like to request a feature - get in touch, we would love to help you out.
