But strangely coincident with the decade ending, we finished fixing most of the major issues and we are now able to work on new features and design improvements (while still continuing to stabilize too). We’ve made some pretty major improvements in the past month, and there’s a lot of exciting things to come!</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-plugin-authentication\">New plugin authentication</h2>\n<p>We changed plugin authentication to a new method that’s fully client-side, which means that no authentication information is ever stored on Moo.do’s servers. This is much better for your privacy and the change fixed a lot of sync bugs too! The downside is you may have to sign into each account again when you open Moo.do on new devices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"board-folders\">Board folders</h2>\n<p>We have a cool new feature for our Premium users for better Board organization. You can right click on a Board to add it to a folder, which you can expand or collapse. Our beta testers have been loving this for helping organize related boards together and hiding workflows they’re not actively using. Board folders is also the basis for a new feature coming next month…</p>\n<h2 id=\"mobile-updates\">Mobile updates</h2>\n<p>We’ve been doing a lot of work on the mobile app, and the latest version brings some big changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sync accounts can now be added and modified</li>\n<li>The collapse button is now on the right side, and tapping to the left of Projects or Bullets zooms in</li>\n<li>The pane header shows the whole breadcrumb trail for easy zooming out</li>\n<li>The keyboard toolbar buttons are smaller and show secondary menus instead of a long scroller</li>\n<li>You can now add documents</li>\n<li>Long press to multiselect/drag works much more reliably</li>\n<li>Dozens of bug fixes (<a href=\"https://www.moo.do/changelog\">see changelog</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"desktop-apps\">Desktop apps</h2>\n<p>We recently released <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/download\">version 1.4.2</a> with a new Global Hotkeys feature along with some bug fixes, mainly to handle Google’s changes in their authentication system. Some previous versions of the desktop apps were not auto-updating themselves properly, so if you have an older version please <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/download\">download</a> the latest version manually.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-help\">New help</h2>\n<p>We redesigned and updated our help system to be a small popup in the bottom right that tracks all of the actions it suggests. We removed the old fullscreen Welcome flow in favor of doing it all in this new Intro. If you haven’t seen it, check out Help in the menu.</p>\n<h2 id=\"settings-ui-design\">Settings UI design</h2>\n<p>Moo.do’s Settings menus were quite ugly and overly complex in the code, so we rewrote their internals to make it easier to add new settings, made their organization and spacing more consistent, and made them much fancier with new animated toggle switches and list selection.</p>\n<h1 id=\"up-next\">Up next</h1>\n<p>We are working on shareable templates, so you can share your meticulously crafted organization systems with others and so new users can get a better idea of where to start. And of course we are continuing to fix bugs and add new features along the way. If there’s anything particularly important to you, please <a href=\"mailto:contact@moo.do\">let us know</a> or join our <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/beta\">beta community</a>.</p>\n"}],"isSinglePost":true}}
