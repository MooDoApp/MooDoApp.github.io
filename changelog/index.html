<h1 id="july-18">July 18</h1>
<ul>
<li><span class="change changeChange">Change</span><span> The “Complete” filter option now works like a normal filter (but reversed), because it was confusing that it worked differently than other filters, and new users got scared when items disappeared and couldn’t find the button to show them. When not enabled it shows everything, click hides completed, Cmd/Ctrl + click shows only completed. It’s set to hide completed by default, so new panes will have a red checkmark filter.</span></li>
<li><span class="change changeChange">Change</span><span> The “Show top level projects” filter to be the opposite: “Show all projects.” So by default project panes will only show top level projects, and the filter option will also show children.
