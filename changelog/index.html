When not enabled it shows everything, click hides completed, Cmd/Ctrl + click shows only completed. It’s set to hide completed by default, so new panes will have a red checkmark filter.</li>\n<li>Change: The “Show top level projects” filter to be the opposite: “Show all projects.” So by default project panes will only show top level projects, and the filter option will also show children. New users were confused that their projects were showing up more than once.</li>\n<li>Change: Filter buttons to be colored text instead of colored background, to reduce distraction.</li>\n<li>Fix: Clicking contact email populates the To field in an email.

If everything has been working fine for you, you should see no change. If you were having problems with plugins getting disabled, or emails not loading, or calendar not syncing correctly, you should now see a message about needing to reauthorize, and clicking the button will fix it. Please let us know if you see anything unusual, or if you’ve had these problems and they are not fixed now.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"july-16\">July 16</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Search was not handling text updates in other panes if pane was filtered but not searched</li>\n<li>Fix: Selection rendering could be offset incorrectly on items in agenda with multiple lines and context showing</li>\n<li>Fix: Only show message about items being hidden/completed once</li>\n<li>Fix: Selection not setting correctly when clicking after the + button in a project</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"july-15\">July 15</h1>\n<h3 id=\"version-1-1-4-of-desktop-apps-download\">Version 1.1.4 of desktop apps: <a href=\"/download/\">Download</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Auto updater was not working for some users.
